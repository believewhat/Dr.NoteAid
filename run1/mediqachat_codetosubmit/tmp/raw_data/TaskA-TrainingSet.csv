11,GENHX,"The patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.","Doctor: I hear someone has a birthday coming up, how old are you turning, ma'am?
Patient: I'll be ninety later this month, doctor. 
Doctor: You're here for a follow up not very long after your first visit. What seems to be the problem today? 
Patient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. 
Doctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? 
Patient: No, I'm not taking that right now. 
Doctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? 
Patient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. 
Doctor: That was one M G per day, correct? 
Patient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. 
Doctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. 
Patient: What is this for, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. 
Patient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. 
Guest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. 
Doctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?
Patient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. 
Doctor: Did you have x rays taken today? 
Patient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. 
Doctor: Good, I have the images right here. 
Patient: What do they show, doctor?
Doctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. 
Patient: What makes you think there's an injury? 
Doctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? 
Patient: No, none. 
Doctor: Then we won't worry about it. 
Patient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.
Doctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? 
Patient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. 
Doctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? 
Patient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. 
Doctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?
Patient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? 
Doctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? 
Patient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. 
Doctor: Do they come and go, the sores? 
Patient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. 
Doctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. 
Patient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. 
Doctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise?

He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back.

Patient: Yes, this is my mommy.

Guest_family: Good morning, doctor. Well, she's thirteen now, but she's had feet problems all her life. 
Doctor: What's been the problem with her feet?
Guest_family: Well, she had bilateral feet corrections when she was a year old. 
Doctor: Okay, how has she been since that procedure?
Guest_family: Well, just look at her heel, doctor. 
Doctor: Yes, I see. She has pretty significant calcaneal valgus deformity. 
Patient: What does that mean, doctor? 
Doctor: Your heel is out of alignment, sweetie. Do you have pain?
Patient: Yes, I have a lot of pain, doctor. 
Guest_family: What can we do about this, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, given all of her symptoms, I think we should do a calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening procedure. 
Guest_family: What does that procedure entail? 
Doctor: Well, in short, we'll go in there and straighten everything out, and get everything lined back up. 
Guest_family: What's the risk of infection with the surgery, sir? 
Doctor: Actually, it's less than one percent, so it's extremely low.
Guest_family: How is this possible, doctor?
Doctor: We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. 
Guest_family: That's great. Will she be asleep for this procedure? 
Doctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. 
Guest_family: Okay, that's good too. What about after the procedure? What's the protocol?
Doctor: Well, I'll need your help. We have to be strict about her being nonweightbearing for six weeks at minimum. 
Guest_family: Will she need a brace too?
Doctor: Yes, at least for six months, but if she does everything I ask of her, it will be only six months. 
Guest_family: Okay, yes, I think we should do the procedure. What do you think, honey?
Patient: Yes, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends.
Doctor: The other risks include bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  I would not worry about these issues, though. It is quite rare. So, looking at her radiographs, the spinal arch is definitely collapsed. I think you guys are making the right decision."

The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.

She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.

Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! 
Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? 
Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. 
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal.

Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. 
Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?
Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. 
Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? 
Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. 
Doctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. 
Doctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? 
Patient: Yeah, I did. 
Doctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right.

307,GENHX,"The patient is a 14-year-old girl who started having left knee pain in the fall of 2007.  She was not seen in Orthopedic Clinic until November 2007.  The patient had an outside MRI performed that demonstrated left patellar chondromalacia only.  The patient was referred to physical therapy for patellar tracking exercises.  She was also given a brace.  The patient reported increasing pain with physical therapy and mother strongly desired other treatment.  It was explained to the mother in detail that this is a difficult problem to treat although majority of the patients get better with physical therapy.  Her failure with nonoperative treatment is below the standard 6-month trial; however, given her symptoms and severe pain, lateral capsular release was offered.  Risk and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery including risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.  All questions were answered, and mother and daughter agreed to the above plans.","Doctor: Good afternoon, dear, how old are you?
Patient: I'm fourteen years old. 
Doctor: Good, and what brings you in for a visit today? 
Patient: My left knee hurts really bad. 
Doctor: Oh no, how long has this knee been hurting you? 
Patient: Well, since the fall of two thousand seven. 
Doctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? 
Patient: Mom, can you tell the doctor?
Guest_family: Yes, actually, we went to another orthopedist in November of two thousand seven.
Doctor: I see, and what did this doctor recommend?
Guest_family: We got an MRI, I have a disc with the images, and the report as well right here, if you want to take a look at it. 
Doctor: Thank you, yes, so this shows left patellar chondromalacia. Has she been to P T?
Guest_family: We got a referral for P T, but they only wanted to do, um, let me look at my notes, patellar tracking exercises. 
Doctor: I see, has she been wearing her brace? 
Guest_family: Yes, she has been. I've been making sure of it. 
Doctor: That's good, and how is your pain today, dear? 
Patient: P T only made the pain much worse, it hurts so much.
Guest_family: Yes, she's in a lot of pain, is there anything else we can do, besides P T?
Doctor: Well, we're in a pretty difficult spot here. The majority of my patients get significantly better by just going to P T. 
Guest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this? 
Doctor: Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. 
Guest_family: What is that?
Doctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. 
Guest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection?
Doctor: The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection.
Patient: Will I be asleep for this?
Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. 
Patient: Will I need to go back to P T?
Doctor: Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.
Guest_family: I think we'd like to do the surgery. What do you think, honey?
Patient: Yeah, I think so too, I want to get back to playing soccer.

He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia.

Doctor: Yes sir. Did you have neck surgery?
Patient: Yeah, I have the op notes right here.

Patient: On, um, August thirty first nineteen ninety three I had an M R I of my neck, and I have that report right here, too. 
Doctor: Thank you, this shows diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa.
Patient: Sorry to interrupt, what does all that mean?
Doctor: Well, that's more tumors in the spine. Did you have another surgery for this?
Patient: Yeah, I had brain surgery. I have those notes right here, too. 
Doctor: Okay, so you had a suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy. The biopsy showed hemangioblastoma. 
Patient: That's cancer, right? This was all done on September first of nineteen ninety three. 
Doctor: Well no, not exactly, it's a benign tumor. After this surgery how were your symptoms?

Doctor: They're low, historically, they're less than one percent. The risks include anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and the motion of walking, and it may also not always cure the toe walking. There is also possible stiffness after wearing the cast and other cast issues. 
Guest_family: Okay, and will be under anesthesia during this? Is this worth it?

She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it ""every other night.""  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times ""snoring"" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).","Doctor: Welcome to the clinic, Miss A. 
Patient: Thank you. 
Doctor: Let's start with your medical history. What medical conditions do you have? 
Patient: Okay. I have high blood pressure, asthma and sleep apnea. I had blood clots in my left leg about six months ago. I also have cancer. 
Doctor: What kind of cancer do you have? 
Patient: I have stomach cancer. They also did a total abdominal hysterectomy. 
Doctor: Did they put you on an anticoagulant medication for the blood clotting? 
Patient: Yes. I took it for six months. I stopped taking it and then I had the stroke. 
Doctor: Have you had any other surgeries? 
Patient: Yes. I had a colonic resection to remove benign polyps. I had another benign lump removed from my breast.  
Doctor: How are you feeling today? 
Patient: I am still having weakness in my left leg. That is why I still have to us my walker, but I have been able to get around easier. 
Doctor: Have you been experiencing any daytime fatigue? 
Patient: No. I have been falling asleep at work. I think it is from looking at my computer screen all day. My supervisor caught me snoring one day and forgot where I was at. My supervisor offered to give me a coffee. This has happened more than once. 
Doctor: This could be due to your sleep apnea. Who is treating you for your sleep apnea? 
Patient: Doctor X did a consult and had me do one of those sleep test about two years ago. I only get sleepy when I look at my computer screen. 
Doctor: Did Doctor X recommend a C P A P machine to use at night? 
Patient: Yes, but I never used to use it. I had another follow up visit with her and she told me that I need to use it every night. I have been using it every other night. 
Doctor: How much uninterrupted sleep do you think that you get per night? 
Patient: Maybe two to five hours, on a good night. 
Doctor: That is not enough sleep. No wonder you are falling asleep at work. I recommend following up again with Doctor X regarding your sleep apnea. You are at a much higher risk for obesity and high cholesterol if you continue to not address the issues you have been having with the lack of sleep and sleep apnea.

Patient: Eighty four.
Doctor: What brings you here?
Patient: I had a fall. And I was told to consult you for my heart conditions.
Doctor: Okay. Um? Can you tell me a little detail about anything you experienced before or diagnosed before?
Patient: Yeah, I have high blood pressure. And they also diagnosed me with other heart diseases. I cannot pronounce all the names I don't remember.
Doctor: That's fine. Let me go through your medical record first. 
Doctor: Let's see what we have here. Looks like you have your plate full. Your record says you had hypertension I mean, high blood pressure. Also, you have a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation. 
Patient: Wow! Those are a lot of fancy words that I can never remember. 
Doctor: Ha ha. So, it says here they they want me to check you for atrial fibrillation. Yet another fancy word to add to your list. 
Patient: What does it mean?
Doctor: It means I must check if you have faster than normal heartbeat after your fall. In simple words, just to check if there are any irregularities in your heart beating, okay?
Patient: Hm, okay.
Doctor: So tell me what happened? How did you fall?
Patient: I'm not sure about how it happened, but yeah, I fell yesterday on my driveway and kind of hit a rock.
Doctor: Which side did you hit the rock?
Patient: Um I think it was left side.
Doctor: What happened in the emergency room?
Patient: They gave me some medicine. And they put something on my finger. They said that my heart rate was very high. 
Doctor: Yeah, in the record it says that they found rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia. So, according to this, they have given you Cardizem and they stopped it when your heart rate came to fifties.
Doctor: Let me review your electrocardiogram from emergency. It says that there was rapid heart rate. Your heart was really beating very fast and then there was one more electrocardiogram which showed that your pacemaker is acting weird. 
Patient: They also did the same test this morning. 
Doctor: One they did this morning shows normal rate with frequent early heartbeats. Looks like they also tested your blood. Your potassium level is three point one. 
Doctor: How was your heart feeling when you fell yesterday?
Patient: I felt that I just ran in a race. I could feel all the pain after that fall. It was ugly. My heart was pounding so fast it was ready to come out, I never felt like that before in my life. 
Doctor: Did you feel the same way afterwards as well?
Patient: No, it was just after fall. It did not stay like that for long, I was normal later. I never felt it again after that incident. 
Doctor: That is good. Do you have any pain or discomfort in your chest?
Patient: I don't think so.
Doctor: How about before the fall? Did you have any pain or discomfort in your chest before the fall?
Patient: Nope.
Doctor: how about shortness of breath?
Patient: No, not even before the fall. I'm able to walk and I'm sure I can climb stairs. Maybe two floors without any problems."

The patient's fracture has healed without incident, although he had significant postoperative stiffness for which he is undergoing physical therapy, as well as use of a Dynasplint.  The patient is neurologically intact distally.  Given the fact that his fracture has healed, surgery was recommended for hardware removal to decrease his irritation with elbow extension from the hardware.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, continued postoperative stiffness.  All questions were answered and the parents agreed to the above plan.","Doctor: Remind me, how did he hurt himself?

Doctor: That's good that he is already in P T. His left elbow fracture is healed, so we should do another surgery in order to remove that hardware. That may help decrease some of the irritation with elbow extension. He looks neurologically intact in terms of movement and reflexed in his wrist and hand. 
Guest_family_1: Yes, I agree. What is the risk of infection of this surgery? 
Doctor: Historically, the risk of infection is less than one percent.

There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm. He has had a 30-year history of neck pain.  He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain.  This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes.  He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain.  He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007.  When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain.  He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase.  He is taking multiple other pain medications.

Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play ""Murder She Wrote"" at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the ""assassin."" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a ""chuckle."" While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing ""Murder She Wrote."" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was ""Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type."" One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her.

Doctor: Okay. 
Guest_family: Kids played a trick with her and they hid a plastic gun, a toy gun in her luggage. As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different. 
Doctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations.

Doctor: How was it after that? 
Guest_family: She seemed to be doing fine and stable throughout November and December, and we were visiting a local neurologist as well, who was evaluating her. He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there's nothing there. 
Doctor: Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? 
Guest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected.

He self medicated ""with over the counter"" antacids and obtained some relief so he did not seek medical attention at that time. Two months prior to current presentation, he had worsening of his pain as well as occasional nausea and vomiting. At this time the patient was found to be H. pylori positive by serology and was treated with triple therapy for two weeks and continued on omeprazole without relief of his pain. The patient felt he had experienced a twenty-pound weight loss since his symptoms began but he also admitted to poor appetite. He stated that he had two to three loose bowel movements a day but denied melena or bright red blood per rectum. Patient denied NSAID use, ethanol abuse or hematemesis. Position did not affect the quality of the pain. Patient denied fever or flushing. He stated he was a very active and healthy individual prior to these recent problems.","Doctor: Hi, the weather outside is beautiful, did you get some sunshine?

Doctor: Can you tell me if it is stabbing pain and if it is related to any specific time of the day?
Patient: Sure, so i do get episodes of stabbing pain but they are not related to meals. Once the wave comes it lasts for only a minute or so.
Doctor: Can you tell me when exactly you noted it?
Patient: Approximately six months back. I took over the counter antacids and got some relief so i did not go to doctor. But two months back it got worse, I do get occasional nausea and vomiting.
Doctor: I can see that they found H pylori positive infection and treated you with triple drug therapy for two weeks and then gave you antacid omeprazole. But it did not improve your pain.
Patient: Yeah that's right.
Patient: Do you know I lost twenty pound of weight since all these symptoms began but i have been also admitted for poor appetite.

She underwent an L3-4 decompression in Month DD, YYYY by Dr. Stanley Gertzbein for back and bilateral lower extremity pain.  Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.  She has apparently spondylolisthesis and L4-5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes evident at both levels.  According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4. The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.  She can walk about a block before her symptoms become debilitating.  She is more comfortable in recumbency.  She denies bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.  She rates her pain as 9/10 in average and her daily level of intensity and 5/10 for her least level of pain.  Alleviating factors include sitting, recumbency, sleeping, and massage.  She treats her pain with Tylenol currently.","Doctor: Hello, miss X Y Z. Dr. X and I will go over your report with you to make sure everything is correct. Then, I will ask you a few questions.

Doctor: Doctor X, did the M R I report of the outside lumbar come in? 
Doctor_2: It did. We also have a report of a lumbar C T myelogram, but no films came. 
Doctor: What does the C T myelogram say? 
Doctor_2: It says she has spondylolisthesis and L four and L 5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes at both levels. 
Doctor: I see. There are some notes from Doctor Reitman. What does it say? 
Doctor_2: It looks like she is being sent for an L four selective nerve root block to rule out if she would be a candidate for a T L I F at L four and L 5. 
Doctor: I see. Could you review the M R I film as well? 
Doctor_2: The M R I reveal a grade two L four anterior spondylolisthesis without major canal stenosis. She does, however, have facet joint disease at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.

Patient: Yes. When I walk and stand. 
Doctor: Are you able to walk at all? 
Patient: I can walk around a block before it gets to the point where I get weak. 
Doctor: When does it feel better? 
Patient: I feel more comfortable when I'm resting, sitting, sleeping, or getting a massage. 
Doctor: From a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain, how would you rate the pain on average?

Doctor: Yes we can. But we'll probably need to do another procedure until his foot matures some more.   This is a stabilizing measure.

832,GENHX,"The patient is a pleasant, 31-year-old, right-handed, white female who injured her shoulder while transferring a patient back on 01/01/02.  She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.  She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.  She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.  She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.  He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.  He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.  She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise.  She is not working.  She is right-hand dominant.

Doctor: Brachial plexopathy? 
Patient: Yes. That sounds right. 
Doctor: Oh, I see his notes in your chart. It says that he felt like you had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of your symptoms. Then it looks like he sent you to get E M G testing at Valley Medical. Let me look for those results. 
Patient: Okey. They should be in my chart. I had Doctor Lin send over all my records. 
Doctor: Here it is. It says that the right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.

The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night. The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night. As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed. In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures. He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.  He generally works from 8 to 8:30 a.m. until approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m.  He is involved in training purpose to how to sell managed funds and accounts. The patient reports no change in daytime stamina.  He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours. The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.","Doctor: Hello, sir how can I help you? Looks like we are talking about snoring today.
Patient: Yeah, I need to get this loud and obnoxious snoring under control. I keep waking up my partner. I have a C P A P right now because I was told I have almost severe sleep apnea.  
Doctor: Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?
Patient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. 
Doctor: So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?
Patient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still. 
Doctor: That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of. 
Patient: Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring. 
Doctor: How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?
Patient: I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night. I may get a little tired during hay fever season, but that is rare.

Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.","Doctor: Good morning, young man.

Guest_family: Yeah, and then they referred us over to Children's. 
Doctor: Have they taken x rays yet?
Patient: Yes, I got back a few minutes ago. 
Doctor: Let's have a look. Well, you broke your leg. 
Patient: What, where? Can you show me?
Doctor: Right here, this is a tibial tubercule avulsion fracture with patella alta. 
Guest_family: What does that mean, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, he's broken his leg, and pulled some bone off by doing so. We'll need to do surgery on this.
Guest_family: Oh no, what's the name of the procedure? 
Doctor: It's called an O R I F. We'll go in there with some hardware to put everything back together, and he can get on the road to healing. 
Guest_family: Let me call his father while we discuss this. What's the risk of infection from this surgery? 
Doctor: Historically, it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. 
Guest_family: Okay, will he be asleep for this? 
Doctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing.
Guest_family: That's good too. Will he need this hardware out in the future?
Doctor: We can remove everything once he has healed up nicely. Other risks include bleeding, changes in the sensation of the leg, hardware failure, need for post op rehab, need for hardware removal, and failure to restore extensor mechanism tension. But I would not worry about these things. I have been doing these surgeries for years and things like this rarely happen.

An x-ray was performed in the Emergency Room, which revealed a grade IV Hawkins classification talus fracture.  He was distal neurovascularly intact.  The patient denied any other complaints besides pain in the ankle. It was for this reason, we elected to undergo the  procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body.  Because of its tenuous blood supply, the patient is at risk for avascular necrosis.  The patient has agreed to undergo the above-named procedure and consent was obtained.

969,GENHX,"The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today.  The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.","Doctor: Good afternoon, who's the victim today, sir? Is it you, or your daughter?

Guest_family: Yeah, I have them right here, take a look, please. 
Doctor: Well, these x rays show an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture, as well as a mildly angulated radial shaft break.

Guest_family: O R I F? What's that
Doctor: I'll put some pins in the elbow, in order to stabilize the break, and we can start the healing process. 
Guest_family: Will this not heal on its own?

Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had ""zig-zag lines"" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.","Doctor: Nurse, did you get the documents from the patient?

1096,GENHX,"Ms. XYZ is an otherwise fairly healthy 44-year-old right-handed aircraft mechanic.  On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between.  She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.  VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain.","Doctor: Good morning, Miss X Y Z, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's me, good morning doctor. 
Doctor: Before we begin, I just need a few pieces of information. How old are you? 
Patient: I'm forty four years young, doctor. 
Doctor: Good, thank you. Next, which hand do you write with? 
Patient: I write with my right hand. 
Doctor: Finally, what do you do for a living? 
Patient: I'm an aircraft mechanic. 
Doctor: Very nice, so, how did you get hurt?
Patient: Um, I was working on repairing an airplane at work when I fell between the plane and one of the stands.
Doctor: How big was the gap that you stepped in?
Patient: Um, it was about a foot and a half. 
Doctor: Which knee did you hurt?
Patient: It was my left knee.
Doctor: Did you have surgery after the accident?
Patient: Yes I did, I had two arthroscopies, and an, um, patellar replacement after those. 
Doctor: Okay, yes, I see.
Patient: Then, I had a left knee replacement on Month D D, Y Y Y Y.
Doctor: Do you have any imaging of this knee? 
Patient: I didn't have any x rays done, but I have an MRI report and notes from Doctor A B C D. 
Doctor: Can I see that report?
Patient: Yes absolutely, here. 
Doctor: Okay, so this M R I from September two thousand six shows some nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but thankfully there's no evidence of fracture of ligamentous avulsion or abnormality. 
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: There's some bleeding in the bone there, but nothing is broken or out of alignment. 
Patient: Oh, thank you, that's good. 
Doctor: Oh certainly, yes, it is. What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery? 
Patient: I've done a full course of PT for this. 
Doctor: Where is your knee pain? 
Patient: Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside.
Doctor: Does the pain go down your leg at all? 
Patient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur? 
Doctor: Yes, that's the femur. 
Patient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too. 
Doctor: Does it go into your thigh at all?
Patient: Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh. I feel numbness and tingling back there. 
Doctor: Do you feel anything in the feet?
Patient: Nope, my feet are completely normal, thankfully.
Doctor: Are you having any back pain? 
Patient: A little, I feel something in my lower back, I'm not sure if it's related.
Doctor: Does anything make your knee pain worse? 
Patient: Yeah, I can hardly walk anymore, it hurts so bad. 
Doctor: What kind of symptoms do you see when you walk on this?
Patient: I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up.
Doctor: That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all?
Patient: Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there.
Doctor: What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?
Patient: No, nothing out of the ordinary there. 
Doctor: What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?
Patient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  
Doctor: Is there any instability? 
Patient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. 
Doctor: Are you working right now?
Patient: No, I'm not right now. 
Doctor: Any allergies I should know about? 
Patient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. 
Doctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?
Patient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. 
Doctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? 
Patient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. 
Doctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? 
Patient: Yeah, it does occasionally. 
Doctor: Does anything make this feel better?
Patient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated. 
Doctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average? 
Patient: Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too. 
Doctor: What about at its worst?
Patient: Easily, its ten out of ten. 
Doctor: Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?
Patient: Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten. I also have this other M R I report from September of O six, here. 
Doctor: Thanks. I see. They said that there is nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but there is no acute fracture or any ligament abnormalities. That's good."

Doctor: Very low, historically, they're less than one percent. 
Patient: How is this possible? 
Doctor: We'll use antibiotics in order to control for infection. 
Patient: That's great, will I be under anesthesia?
Doctor: Yes, you'll be asleep for the whole thing. 
Patient: Great, yes, I'd like to have this done, I can't keep living in this pain.

Patient: Yes, thankfully, I have complete control over everything like that still. 
Doctor: Do you wear a brace or corset normally?
Patient: Yes, I usually wear both. 
Doctor: Okay, last question, can you notice any weakness in your body? 
Patient: No, I'm still very strong, even at my age."
1098,GENHX,"The patient is an 18-year-old girl brought in by her father today for evaluation of a right knee injury.  She states that approximately 3 days ago while playing tennis she had a non-contact injury in which she injured the right knee.  She had immediate pain and swelling.  At this time, she complains of pain and instability in the knee.  The patient's past medical history is significant for having had an ACL injury to the knee in 2008.  She underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by Dr. X at that time, subsequently in the same year she developed laxity of the graft due in part to noncompliance and subsequently, she sought attention from Dr. Y who performed a revision ACL reconstruction at the end of 2008.  The patient states she rehabbed the knee well after that and did fine with good stability of the knee until this recent injury.","Doctor: Good afternoon, sir, and who's the patient today? You, or your daughter?

Patient: I'm eighteen. 
Doctor: What seems to be the problem today?
Patient: I hurt my right knee while playing tennis, um, it was about three days ago now. It really hurts. 
Doctor: I see, tennis, huh? Was there any contact involved?
Patient: No, I took a step wrong when I went for an awkward shot. 
Doctor: Are you able to stand on this knee?
Patient: Not well, it feels unstable, like I'm going to fall over.  
Doctor: Have you ever hurt this knee before?
Patient: Yeah, tore my ACL in two thousand eight. 
Doctor: I assume you had surgery for that?
Patient: Yeah I did, um, with Doctor X. He called it an, um, A C L reconstruction.
Doctor: How did you recover from this?
Guest_family: She didn't do well, she didn't do what we or the others doctors suggested, and the knee never really got the same tightness back.
Doctor: What did they do about that?
Guest_family: I have it in my notes here, they did an, um, A C L revision. That was done by Doctor Y.
Doctor: When was that done?
Guest_family: Looks like it was at the end of two thousand eight. 
Doctor: Following the revision, how did you cover?
Patient: I did everything they said, I did it exactly as they wanted, and I did fine until this last injury.

He has been worked up by several specialists and evaluated.  He was thought initially to have low back pain with radiculopathy.  He does have a history of antibiotic steroid use as well as heavy drinking.  He reports his symptoms started approximately eight years ago when he was doing some construction at which time he began to have left hip pain.  He has had difficulties on and off ever since then.  On the last visit, radiographs revealed severe degenerative changes of the left hip joint with apparent AVN of the left femoral head.  He was given some pain medication and discussion took place regarding referring him to a specialist for evaluation of possible hip resurfacing versus conventional total hip replacement.  He came for a second opinion in the area and we discussed his problems further.  He continues to have primarily groin pain, which limits his daily activities.  He has used a cane in the past for a short period and he continues to have difficulty with the left hip.","Doctor: So, how are long have you had pain in this hip?

1115,GENHX,"This is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.","Doctor: Hello, miss. Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?
Patient: I'm twenty five years old. 
Doctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?
Doctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. 
Doctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? 
Doctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. 
Doctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.
Doctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? 
Doctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? 
Patient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.
Doctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? 
Doctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. 
Doctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. 
Doctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. 
Doctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? 
Doctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. 
Doctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? 
Doctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. 
Doctor: Could you explain what it says?
Doctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. 
Doctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? 
Doctor_2: That is correct. 
Doctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? 
Doctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. 
Doctor: What lupus serologies were used? 
Doctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. 
Doctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? 
Doctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. 
Doctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? 
Doctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. 
Doctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. 
Doctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. 
Doctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?
Doctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. 
Doctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?
Doctor_2: That's correct. 
Doctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? 
Patient: I tried my best to. 
Doctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.
Doctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?
Doctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. 
Doctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? 
Doctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. 
Doctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? 
Doctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. 
Doctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. 
Patient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. 
Doctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?
Doctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. 
Doctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? 
Doctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. 
Doctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?
Doctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. 
Doctor: What was she places on after?
Doctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. 
Doctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? 
Doctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. 
Doctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? 
Patient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. 
Doctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. 
Doctor: Did they find anything apparent? 
Doctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. 
Doctor: What was the plan following that? 
Docotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. 
Doctor: Was there any medication prescribed? 
Doctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. 
Doctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? 
Doctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am?

1157,GENHX,"The patient is a 44-year-old white female who is here today with multiple problems.  The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.","Doctor: Okay I am looking at you for multiple issues today. One of the biggest being swelling on your left leg. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yes sure. I got this swelling for almost three years now, and it has been worse for the past two to three months.

Doctor: How old are you, miss?
Patient: I am forty four. My biggest problem is this pain in my left shoulder. I feel as if this low back pain is due to a poor mattress.

Doctor: Ok let's look at your labs.

1198,GENHX,"This patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.","Doctor: How are you doing today, sir? 
Patient: Honestly, I'm pretty sick today. I've got a lot going on. 
Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?
Patient: Well, it's been off and on for about a month now. 
Doctor: Has it been getting worse recently? 
Patient: Yeah, it has over the last couple weeks. 
Doctor: What are your symptoms? 
Patient: Well, I'm coughing up this yellow phlegm. It feels like everything is in my chest. 
Doctor: What medications have you been taking for this?
Patient: I've been taking Allegra D sometimes, but I'm almost out. I need a refill. 
Doctor: What other problems are you having? 
Patient: My foot keeps breaking out. 
Doctor: Has this improved at all? 
Patient: Well, it was for a while, but now it's really bad again. 
Doctor: Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before? 
Patient: I had, um, tinea pedis before. 
Doctor: How was this treated?
Patient: They gave me Nizoral cream.
Doctor: It has been getting warmer recently, I don't think that this isn't necessarily a coincidence that you're having these symptoms now.
Patient: Yeah, I work in the flint and it's really hot and humid down there.  
Doctor: What else are you dealing with, sir? 
Patient: I have this wart on my right middle finger, are you able to freeze it off? 
Doctor: Have you ever done that before? 
Patient: Yeah, you have done it before, and it went away. 
Doctor: If we've done it before, we can do it again. 
Patient: Cool, can we do blood work, too? I want to check on my prostate. 
Doctor: Well, that's called P S A. 
Patient: Can I have that done? I'm concerned. I am fifty after all. 
Doctor: Sure, we can check your cholesterol too. I know you have history of it being high. 
Patient: You know, I've been working on that. I quit smoking for a while, but I got back into it.
