Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. Did you have a good thirty-sixth birthday?
Patient: Yes, thank you. It was a nice day, despite the knee pain. 
Doctor: That's good, we'll get back to that knee in a moment. Just to confirm, you identify as white, correct? 
Patient: Yes, I do. 
Doctor: Thank you. I just needed to make sure my chart was correct. So, is this left knee still bothering you? 
Patient: Yes, unfortunately, it still is.
Doctor: You've had three Synvisc injections, correct? When was your last one?
Patient: Yes, that was about five days ago, right before my birthday. 
Doctor: Did that provide any relief at all?  
Patient: Well, I'd say there's been, um, thirty-five or forty percent improvement. 
Doctor: Are you still having the pinching pain?
Patient: Yes, it's so bad when I try to put my full weight onto this knee. 
Doctor: Can you bend this knee at all?
Patient: Ow, no, please stop. I can't handle that bending, doctor. 
Doctor: Can you straighten the knee out for me, please? 
Patient: No, not all the way, look. 
Doctor: Yes, that's not out all the way. 
Patient: It hurts really bad, doctor. 
Doctor: With ten being the worst pain ever, how would you rate your pain today out of ten?
Patient: Oh, it's easily a ten out of ten. 
Doctor: Have you used ice or heat? 
Patient: Yes, I use both. I alternate the two. 
Doctor: What medicines are you taking?
Patient: I'm using that Tylenol with codeine you gave me and then some ibuprofen I got from the grocery store. 
Doctor: Have those helped at all?
Patient: I'd say they helped pretty minimally.
