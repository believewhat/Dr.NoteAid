Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining that for me. 
Doctor: You're very welcome, my dear. So, you don't have his reports, but do you remember how this has been treated in the past? 
Patient: So far, I've had two cortisone shots. 
Doctor: I see. So, what do you do for fun? Do you have any hobbies?

Doctor: Does this make the pain worse?
Patient: Yes, but only from time to time. 
Doctor: I see. Do you take anti-inflammatories when the pain gets bad?
