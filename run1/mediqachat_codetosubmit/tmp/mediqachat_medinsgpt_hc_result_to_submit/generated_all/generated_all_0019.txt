Doctor: Nice to see you again, miss. I see your last visit was back on August tenth two thousand and four. How are you?
Patient: Hi, doctor. Nice to see you again as well. I've been doing fine. 
Doctor: How is your husband doing? 
Patient: He's doing fine. Just working a lot. 
Doctor: Great! I hope the work isn't getting him too stressed out. Also, I need to fill out the ethnicity section in your paperwork; it seems to be missing. What ethnicity do you identify as?
Patient: Oh, yes. I am white. 
Doctor: Thanks! Are you still working too? 
Patient: Yeah, I am. My secretary position has been super stressful lately. 
Doctor: I understand. How is your acne doing? 
Patient: I think it's been getting better, but I've had this rash for the last two months on my chest, stomach, neck, and back. 
Doctor: I see. Let me take a look at this rash. I see you have these small folliculitis lesions that are pus filled bumps centered on your hair. 
Patient: Oh, no. Is that bad? 
Doctor: It's treatable. It seems like it's happening because your acne is flaring up. 
Patient: Oh, really. Is it because I stopped my medication for the last three days? 
Doctor: I forgot what I prescribed you. Let me take a look at my notes. Oh, I see. I prescribed you five hundred milligrams of Amoxicillin to take twice a day and a point one Tazorac cream. Have those been working? 
Patient: Yeah, they have. I noticed my face started to get better. 
Doctor: Continue to take those and try not to stop it. Have you been trying anything else? 
Patient: I actually started going to Healing Waters to get photofacials. 
Doctor: I see. Has that been helpful? 
Patient: Yeah, it has, but I want a faster treatment. I'm only forty nine and want to look younger. Are there any procedures or skin care products that can be used to help my face look better?
