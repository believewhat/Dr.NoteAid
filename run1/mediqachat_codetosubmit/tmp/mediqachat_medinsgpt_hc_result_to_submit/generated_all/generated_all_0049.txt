Doctor: You were having right leg pain when you saw him? 
Patient: Yes.

Doctor: How did you respond to the procedure? 
Patient: Well, I had lower back pain and some arthritis in my spine after. 
Doctor: How have you been treated for these following the surgery? 
Patient: Um, Doctor X Y Z did some injections into my lower back. 
Doctor: Do you remember which side it was in?

Doctor: When was that?
Patient: Um, it was on April seventh two thousand five, and the last time I saw him was April fifteenth. 
Doctor: Is that when you had the last injections? 
Patient: Correct.
