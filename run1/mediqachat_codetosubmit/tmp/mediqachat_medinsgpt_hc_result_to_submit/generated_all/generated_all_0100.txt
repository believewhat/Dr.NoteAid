Doctor: I'm sorry to see that she's not doing well.  
Guest_family: I can't even begin to tell you how hard this past week has been for us. She has had so much congestion. She's also coughed more than she ever has before. She is only two months old and it breaks my heart to see her like this.
Doctor: Oh wow. We'll see what we can do for her. How's her breathing been? 
Guest_family: She's had some irregular breathing where she would breathe very quickly and retract.  
Doctor: Has she been running a fever? 
Guest_family: She's been running in the hundreds between one O two and one O four. 
Doctor: Has she been feeding well? 
Guest_family: No, not at all. She's been feeding less and I notice she hasn't had as many wet diapers as a result. 
Doctor: Is anyone else in the family sick? 
Guest_family: My son has an upper respiratory infection.  
Doctor: How long has he been sick? 
Guest_family: A day or two before our two month old. 
Doctor: You mentioned that she's been coughing a lot. Is she bringing anything up with her coughs?  
Guest_family: Yeah, I think her coughs trigger some sort of reflex response, causing her to spit up or throw up a few times. It comes on so suddenly, it takes me by surprise. 
Doctor: Does she happen to experience similar symptoms after her feedings? 
Guest_family: Yeah, that's new too. 
Doctor: Any diarrhea? 
Guest_family: None.
