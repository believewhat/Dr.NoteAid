Doctor: Hello there, how are you doing? 
Patient: I'm doing good. Thank you. How about you? 
Doctor: Yeah, same old, same old. 
Doctor: So, looks like we're here to discuss your diet. Is that right? 
Patient: Yep. That's right. 
Doctor: Okay, let me look through your chart. It looks like you have high lipid levels, high blood pressure and a possibility for a metabolic syndrome. 
Patient: That looks like my chart. I'm kind of struggling here and I need your help. 
Doctor: Yeah, tell me did you follow the meal plan that we gave to you? 
Patient: I tried for many weeks to follow that meal plan that you gave me. 
Doctor: Okay, did it help? 
Patient: I don't know. I felt like I was still gaining weight instead of losing it. 
Doctor: Did you follow it exactly as you are, as you were asked to do?
Patient: I tried my best. But I feel like I am not doing it correctly or something. 
Doctor: Okay, tell me what kind of activities are you doing? How much physical activity are you doing on a regular basis? 
Patient: I try to walk around one and a half to two miles like every other day, but I'm spending more time in my garden and doing the yard work by myself. 
Doctor: That's good. Gardening gets-- can get hard and it helps you keep active. 
Patient: Oh yes, picking up all those pots from here to there and knowing that backyard of mine, it's a hard job. 
Doctor: Tell me what brings you here today? Like how can I help you? 
Patient: So, I think the meal plan that you gave was not working for me and there was definitely some weight gain, so I went back to my old South Beach Diet. 
Doctor: Okay. What were the results with your South Beach Diet then? Was it effective? 
Patient: I was able to get some pounds off. I felt pretty good about it. 
Doctor: That's good. Then what's the issue? 
Patient: Well, you see, deep in my heart I know this South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for me and that's why I'm back to you. 
Doctor: I appreciate your honesty. You don't know how happy you made me by saying that. 
Patient: Yeah. You know, I'm here. So, tell me what to do to lose all this extra weight and how to enforce a low fat diet? What are your recommendations for that? 
Doctor: Let's set a plan for you.
