Doctor: Good morning, young man. Is this your mother?
Patient: Yes, doctor.
Doctor: Good, nice to mee you. Can you tell me more about your son, please? 
Guest_family: Good morning to you too, doctor. Well, he's about five and a half now, and he broke both the bones in his forearm in September of two thousand seven. 
Doctor: How did the fracture heal? Generally, children heal very well. 
Guest_family: Well, yes, until he also rebroke it about a month ago. 
Doctor: Yes, I see now, there's an ulnar nail pretty prominently visible under the skin, did he have surgery for this? 
Guest_family: Yes, about a month ago now. Should we remove the nail?
Doctor: We'll have to, even though its early.
Guest_family: What will we do after the nail is removed? 
Doctor: After that, we'll put him back in a cast for about another three weeks. We'll evaluate him and see how he's doing.  
Guest_family: Okay. What are the risks of infection for this surgery?
Doctor: The risk of infection is overall very low, honestly its less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, or need for longer casting. I would not worry too much about these risks. I have not seen anything bad happen before.
Guest_family_1: Will he be asleep for the surgery?
Doctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing.
