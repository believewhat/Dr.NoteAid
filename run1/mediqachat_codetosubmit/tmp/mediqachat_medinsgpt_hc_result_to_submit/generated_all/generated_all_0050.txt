Doctor: Mister Sunil, your blood pressure is high, and I am noticing this from past two-three times you have been here. It's been constantly high, you are not taking it seriously. 
Patient: No, nothing like that Doctor! It's been well under control. I have been monitoring at home.
Doctor: Are you noting your readings? Did you bring it with you?
Patient: No. I did not get the readings with me but I assure you I am taking care and my B P is normal.
Doctor: Well, it's up and I am little bothered by it.

dialogue:
Doctor: Hello, sir. How are you doing today? 
Patient: I hurt my left wrist again. 
Doctor: Oh, no. Again? Did you hurt it before?
Patient: Yeah, I did. I've actually hurt it a lot. The most recent one was probably the worst pain of my life. 
Doctor: I see. How did you hurt it? 
Patient: I was lifting some things out of the trunk of my car, and it started hurting. 
Doctor: Did it hurt before that? 
Patient: Yeah, it did. It was sore and stuff, but the pain wasn't bothering me too much. I kind of just lived with it. Some days it would be fine, but other days it would hurt a little more. 
Doctor: The recent injury made it worse?
Patient: Yeah, it did. The pain after the incident got worse. I kind of feel it now more near my pinky area than my thumb area. 
Doctor: I see. So, near your ulnar side and not as much the radial side. You said earlier your wrist was already sore, right? Why was that? 
Patient: Remember how I told you about the time I had the worst pain of my life? That's how. I have some old notes you can see. Here you go. 
Doctor: Thank you. Oh, wow. It says here you have chronic scapholunate problems and other problems too. 
Patient: My scapho- what? 
Doctor: It's just some ligament damage in your wrist. I'll see what we can do to get your wrist feeling better.
