Doctor: And how would you describe your periods? Light, normal, heavy? 
Patient: Pretty normal. 
Doctor: Any abnormal pap smears? 
Patient: No, fortunately they've all been normal. 
Doctor: That's wonderful to hear. And my last question for you is if you've ever gotten a mammogram? 
Patient: I haven't gotten one before. Do I need to get one? I just turned thirty nine. What's the recommended age again? 
Doctor: It depends. For example, the recommended age would be younger for someone who has a family history of breast cancer. Given that you don't have a positive family history of breast cancer, I'd advise getting one in a few years at the age of forty five.
