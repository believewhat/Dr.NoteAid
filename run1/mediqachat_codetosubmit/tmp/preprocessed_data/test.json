Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.  \nDoctor: I don't see any labs in your chart.

Yes, doctor. That's correct. \nDoctor: Okay, walk me through this. So, you've seen doctor X Y Z before, correct? \nPatient: Yes, that's right. I saw him for low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and symptomatic right L two radiculopathy.\nDoctor: You were having right leg pain when you saw him? \nPatient: Yes. \nDoctor: Have you ever had surgery on your back? \nPatient: Yes, I had spinal stenosis, so they did, um, a laminectomy. \nDoctor: How did you respond to the procedure? \nPatient: Well, I had lower back pain and some arthritis in my spine after. \nDoctor: How have you been treated for these following the surgery? \nPatient: Um, Doctor X Y Z did some injections into my lower back. \nDoctor: Do you remember which side it was in?\nPatient: It was in the right side, L2-L3.\nDoctor: When was the last time you had these injections into the lower back?\nPatient: The last one was in March of two thousand five. \nDoctor: How did your symptoms progress following the injections? \nPatient: Well, I went back to Doctor X Y Z, and then he thought that the symptoms I was having were coming from my right hip. \nDoctor: Did he do any imaging on this hip? \nPatient: Yes, I had some done when I saw him on, um, August fourth two thousand four. \nDoctor: Okay, the x rays we took today show marked degenerative changes, and a progression since the x rays taken back in August when you saw Doctor X Y Z. \nPatient: Oh no. Oh, he also did the injections into my right hip. \nDoctor: When was that?\nPatient: Um, it was on April seventh two thousand five, and the last time I saw him was April fifteenth. \nDoctor: Is that when you had the last injections? \nPatient: Correct. \nDoctor: Has anyone talked to you about doing a hip replacement?\nPatient: Yes, but right now I'm not sure if I want to do it. \nDoctor: Are you still having pain in that right hip today?\nPatient: Yes, it still hurts. \nDoctor: What makes the pain worse? \nPatient: Well, anything that puts weight on this hip hurts really bad. \nDoctor: Okay, if it hurts that bad you should be using a cane. Did you ever get one?\nPatient: Yes, I used one to come in here today, in fact. \nDoctor: Good. Do you have any other appointments scheduled?\nPatient: Yeah, I made an appointment with an orthopedist in Newton. It's closer to my house. \nDoctor: That's fine. What medicines are you taking? \nPatient: Um, I take the generic for Ultracet. Sometimes I take as many as four times a day. \nDoctor: Does this help the pain?\nPatient: No, I'm still in pretty significant pain, doctor."}
