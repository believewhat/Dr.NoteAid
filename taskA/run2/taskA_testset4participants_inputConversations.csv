Patient: Oh, no. Is that bad? 
Doctor: It's treatable. It seems like it's happening because your acne is flaring up. 
Patient: Oh, really. Is it because I stopped my medication for the last three days?

Patient: Hello! It is nice to meet you. 
Doctor: What brings you into see me today? 
Patient: I have had this weakness in my right leg for quite some time now.
Doctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?
Patient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. 
Doctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? 
Patient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.
Doctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. 
Doctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? 
Patient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.  
Doctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: I would say mild. I have also been having cramping in both calves. 
Doctor: How long has that been going on? 
Patient: For the past year but it stopped about two months ago.  
Doctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? 
Patient: No. I don't think so. 
Doctor: Have you had any pain around right leg and the area of numbness and tingling? 
Patient: No. Everything that is going on with my right leg has pretty much been the same since it started six months ago. I have not gotten worse or better. 
Doctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain?
Patient: No.
Doctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.
Patient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. 
Doctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? 
Patient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  
Doctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? 
Patient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.
Doctor: What medications are those? 
Patient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. 
Doctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? 
Patient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.  
Doctor: I don't see any labs in your chart. Did your primary do labs for your CK levels? 
Patient: Yes, he did. 
Doctor: Okay. Have you started any other medications? 
Patient: Yes, I just started Zetia.
Doctor: Have you experienced any weakness or pain after starting Zetia? 
Patient: No.
Doctor: Can you remind me how old you are?
Patient: I am fifty-five."
32,"Doctor: I spoke with Poison Control regarding the possible ingestion of the liquid. They let me know that it is actually a relatively small amount and is likely to be a nontoxic ingestion of the liquid, if she did end up ingesting it. It is not likely to be the case as she is behaving as if she did not ingest any of the liquid.
Guest_family: Thank god! Thank you."
33,"Doctor: Do you smoke cigarettes?
Patient: No, I do not.
Doctor: Good, no one should.
Patient: Yeah, it's a bad habit.
Doctor: Okay. How about alcohol?
Patient: No, I don't drink either.
Doctor: Okay.
Patient: Yeah."
34,"Doctor: How are your sugar levels these days, sir?

35,"Doctor: And how about any allergies? Are you allergic to any drug or anything?
Patient: Ah, yes I am very allergic to Bactrim. 
Doctor: It causes you side effects?
Patient: Yes, It causes me nausea and vomiting. 
Doctor: I see. 
Patient: I think I am also allergic to adhesive tape. I get this skin rash almost immediately if I use adhesive tapes.

38,"Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. Did you have a good thirty-sixth birthday?

Patient: Yes, I do. 
Doctor: Thank you. I just needed to make sure my chart was correct. So, is this left knee still bothering you? 
Patient: Yes, unfortunately, it still is.
Doctor: You've had three Synvisc injections, correct? When was your last one?
Patient: Yes, that was about five days ago, right before my birthday. 
Doctor: Did that provide any relief at all?  
Patient: Well, I'd say there's been, um, thirty-five or forty percent improvement. 
Doctor: Are you still having the pinching pain?
Patient: Yes, it's so bad when I try to put my full weight onto this knee. 
Doctor: Can you bend this knee at all?
Patient: Ow, no, please stop. I can't handle that bending, doctor. 
Doctor: Can you straighten the knee out for me, please? 
Patient: No, not all the way, look. 
Doctor: Yes, that's not out all the way. 
Patient: It hurts really bad, doctor. 
Doctor: With ten being the worst pain ever, how would you rate your pain today out of ten?
Patient: Oh, it's easily a ten out of ten. 
Doctor: Have you used ice or heat? 
Patient: Yes, I use both. I alternate the two. 
Doctor: What medicines are you taking?
Patient: I'm using that Tylenol with codeine you gave me and then some ibuprofen I got from the grocery store. 
Doctor: Have those helped at all?
Patient: I'd say they helped pretty minimally."
39,"Doctor: Hello, how are you doing today? Before we get started, I am going to do a basic review of your medical and social history. 
Patient: Sounds good. Nothing has changed from last visit. 
Doctor: On your chart we have that you are a non smoker, non drinker, and do not use drugs. We also have written that you do not have any past surgeries or medical conditions. Does that check out?
Patient: Yes. That's all the same as last time."
40,"Doctor: So I talked to Doctor X about your problems.

46,"Doctor: Any medical problems? 
Patient: Yeah, I've been suffering from congestion for a few years now.
Doctor: Have you seen an ENT for this? 
Patient: I did a year or so ago. They think it could be due to enlarged adenoids or just my anatomy.  
Doctor: Do you have plans to see the ENT in the near future? 
Patient: No, not as of right now. 
Doctor: If it's causing you discomfort, then I recommend scheduling another follow-up visit. Is there anything else that's bothering you today?

Doctor: Did he do any imaging on this hip? 
Patient: Yes, I had some done when I saw him on, um, August fourth two thousand four. 
Doctor: Okay, the x rays we took today show marked degenerative changes, and a progression since the x rays taken back in August when you saw Doctor X Y Z.

Patient: I hurt my left wrist again.

Doctor: I see. How did you hurt it? 
Patient: I was lifting some things out of the trunk of my car, and it started hurting. 
Doctor: Did it hurt before that? 
Patient: Yeah, it did. It was sore and stuff, but the pain wasn't bothering me too much. I kind of just lived with it. Some days it would be fine, but other days it would hurt a little more. 
Doctor: The recent injury made it worse?
Patient: Yeah, it did. The pain after the incident got worse. I kind of feel it now more near my pinky area than my thumb area. 
Doctor: I see. So, near your ulnar side and not as much the radial side. You said earlier your wrist was already sore, right? Why was that? 
Patient: Remember how I told you about the time I had the worst pain of my life? That's how. I have some old notes you can see. Here you go. 
Doctor: Thank you. Oh, wow. It says here you have chronic scapholunate problems and other problems too. 
Patient: My scapho- what? 
Doctor: It's just some ligament damage in your wrist. I'll see what we can do to get your wrist feeling better."
51,"Doctor: So, just to confirm, no current medications? 
Patient: Yes, that's right."
52,"Doctor: Any allergies to medicine he might have? 
Guest_family: No, no allergies that we know of.

Patient: That's okay. I have nothing to hide.
Doctor: Are you married?
Patient: I was, but I lost my wife six months ago. I live alone now. 
Doctor: Do you smoke or drink? Have you ever tried any illegal drug? 
Patient: No, none of these. 
Doctor: Are you working? 
Patient: I'm retired now. 
Doctor: How active will you call yourself? 
Patient: Hm, I'll say very active. I walk around four miles every day."
54,"Doctor: Have you been checking your blood sugar regularly? 
Patient: Yes, I check it twice a day and I make sure to record the readings each time. 
Doctor: That's great to hear. Do you mind if I take a look at the readings you brought with you today? 
Patient: No, it's not a problem. Here, let me get my bag. 
Doctor: Have you been experiencing any dizziness, excessive urination, fatigue, weight loss, or any other symptoms? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: I have a copy of your blood work right here and it looks like your cholesterol is still pretty high. I'd like you to continue taking the cholesterol medication I prescribed and monitoring your cholesterol intake. 
Patient: I need to do a better job of watching my cholesterol. 
Doctor: For this reason, I'd like to schedule another follow up appointment and get you in in a few weeks after another blood draw. 
Patient: I'll make an appointment today before I leave. 
Doctor: Great, good. And how are your sinus symptoms since starting the Z Pak?

57,"Doctor: What brings you into the office today?  
Patient: I have been feeling strange lately.  
Doctor: Strange, in what way?  
Patient: Well, the other day I was driving and suddenly, I didn't know where I was or where I was driving to.    
Doctor: That must have been very scary for you. How long did you feel disoriented?  
Patient: It seemed to last about ten or fifteen minutes.  
Doctor: Has anything like this happened before?  
Patient: It has happened two times before this, but I was not driving.  
Doctor: I would like to send you to a specialist to get some cognitive tests done.   
Patient: Okay."
58,"Doctor: I'm going to run through a list of symptoms and if you're experiencing one or more of these, please let me know. 
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: You had previously mentioned that you sometimes experience an overactive bladder. Are you having any pain with urination or other urinary symptoms along with it? 
Patient: No. Just occasionally, when I am really stressed, I start having trouble controlling my bladder.
Doctor: How about abdominal pain, excessive thirst or eating?
Patient: No. 
Doctor: And no constipation, diarrhea, or heartburn? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: How about chest pain or tightness, shortness of breath, headaches, or fever?

Patient: Yes, my mother and her two sisters have long term asthma.
Doctor: Okay.
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: Any other diseases like kidney problems?
Patient: No kidney problems.
Doctor: Any rheumatological disorders?
Patient: Oh, no, no. Nothing like that."
60,"Doctor: Your E K G looks good. Rhythm is normal. Your axis is somewhat leftward, but this is a normal variation. It is not an abnormal finding and in most cases does not need any further treatment.
Patient: How about blood tests?
Doctor: Your CBC and BMP came back normal and your cardiac enzymes were negative x1.
Doctor: Do you know what they are?
Patient: Yes, I can understand."
61,"Doctor: What are your current medications?
Patient: None, except the Amoxil and Aldex that I started on Monday. "
62,"Guest_clinician: How old is the patient? 
Doctor: She's seventeen years old. 
Guest_clinician: Did they determine what was obstructing her airways? 
Doctor: Yes, they found a two millimeter fishbone lodged in her throat. She had to be intubated and taken straight to the O R."
63,"Doctor: Hello there, how are you doing? 
Patient: I'm doing good. Thank you. How about you? 
Doctor: Yeah, same old, same old. 
Doctor: So, looks like we're here to discuss your diet. Is that right? 
Patient: Yep. That's right. 
Doctor: Okay, let me look through your chart. It looks like you have high lipid levels, high blood pressure and a possibility for a metabolic syndrome. 
Patient: That looks like my chart. I'm kind of struggling here and I need your help. 
Doctor: Yeah, tell me did you follow the meal plan that we gave to you? 
Patient: I tried for many weeks to follow that meal plan that you gave me. 
Doctor: Okay, did it help? 
Patient: I don't know. I felt like I was still gaining weight instead of losing it. 
Doctor: Did you follow it exactly as you are, as you were asked to do?
Patient: I tried my best. But I feel like I am not doing it correctly or something. 
Doctor: Okay, tell me what kind of activities are you doing? How much physical activity are you doing on a regular basis? 
Patient: I try to walk around one and a half to two miles like every other day, but I'm spending more time in my garden and doing the yard work by myself. 
Doctor: That's good. Gardening gets-- can get hard and it helps you keep active. 
Patient: Oh yes, picking up all those pots from here to there and knowing that backyard of mine, it's a hard job. 
Doctor: Tell me what brings you here today? Like how can I help you? 
Patient: So, I think the meal plan that you gave was not working for me and there was definitely some weight gain, so I went back to my old South Beach Diet. 
Doctor: Okay. What were the results with your South Beach Diet then? Was it effective? 
Patient: I was able to get some pounds off. I felt pretty good about it. 
Doctor: That's good. Then what's the issue? 
Patient: Well, you see, deep in my heart I know this South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for me and that's why I'm back to you. 
Doctor: I appreciate your honesty. You don't know how happy you made me by saying that. 
Patient: Yeah. You know, I'm here. So, tell me what to do to lose all this extra weight and how to enforce a low fat diet? What are your recommendations for that? 
Doctor: Let's set a plan for you."
64,"Doctor: How're you feeling today? 
Patient: Honestly, I've had way better days. 
Doctor: I'm sorry. Why is that? 
Patient: I've been getting short of breath a lot more than I'm used to. 
Doctor: How long has this been going on? 
Patient: Past three days. 
Doctor: Are you experiencing any leg pain or swelling? 
Patient: Eh no.  
Doctor: How about chest pain or anything like it? 
Patient: No to that either. 
Doctor: I must say, this is concerning. I'd like you to get a C T scan of your chest so we can see what's going on. For now, your pulse ox is in the high nineties so you won't be needing supplemental oxygen at this moment in time. Do you notice the shortness of breath getting worse when you're moving around? 
Patient: Yeah, mostly when I exert myself. 
Doctor: Okay, I see. And the frequency by which your're short of breath is new for you, correct? 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: Do you happen to have a history of asthma? 
Patient: No asthma."
65,"Doctor: Hi, how are you?
Patient: I am well. I am feeling a much better.
Doctor: That's good. I gave you cycle seven ifosphomide, mesna and VP 16 chemotherapy.
Patient: Okay I don't understand what that means."
66,"Doctor: You have hypothyroidism, correct? 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: Have you been watching your blood sugar? 
Patient: Yes. It's been fine lately so has my anemia. 
Doctor: Good to hear. I see here you were diagnosed with I B S and bowel abnormalities a few years ago. 
Patient: My most recent bouts of diarrhea were likely due to C diff and they seem to have gotten better. 
Doctor: I see my nurse didn't have the chance to go through the review of systems with you, so I will go through them now.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
Patient: Nope.
Doctor: Any unusual weight gain or loss?
Patient: No, my weight has been stable.
Doctor: Any visual changes, in one or both eyes?
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Any hearing changes or ear problems?
Patient: Nope.
Doctor: I know I already asked you about your hypothyroidism, but I wanted to check if you are having any excessive thirst or frequent urination?
Patient: Nope, none of that.
Doctor: Any shortness of breath, cough, coughing up excessive mucus or blood, or breathing problems?
Patient: Thankfully none of that.
Doctor: Okay, how about any kind of chest pain or discomfort, trouble breathing at night or when lying down, palpitations or heart attacks?
Patient: No, none of that.
Doctor: Any urinary problems, anything with your kidneys?
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Any abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge?
Patient: Nope.
Doctor: Good, I know you have had some anemia in the past, any new problems with that? Any blackouts, convulsions, seizures, paralysis, strokes, or headaches?
Patient: No, I have not had anemic labs in a while. And, no to any of those things you just listed as well.
Doctor: Alright, good. That is it for all of my symtom questions. Thank you for bearing with me for that.
Patient: No problem, I am just glad to not be experiencing a lot of those."
67,"Doctor: How old are you? 
Patient: Fifty six. 
Doctor: Are you right handed or left handed? 
Patient: I'm right handed.
Doctor: So, you have this long standing on and off lower back pain on your right side. And it all happened after your motor vehicle accident in September of two thousand and five. 
Patient: That's right. Right after accident. At that time, I did not feel anything, but five days later I started getting this abnormal like pain in the lower side of my back, especially on the right side. It kind of like moved from there to my buttocks on the posterior side on my thigh and on outside of my calf. 
Doctor: Does anything elevate your pain or decreases it? 
Patient: It gets worse when I'm sitting for a longer period, such as like driving or if I'm walking for a long period of time. It is a little less bad when walking, but still, it is there. Lying down relieves the pain for a bit and also standing helps. 
Doctor: Is there any symptom like weakness or pain in your left leg or your right leg? 
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: Any change in your bowel movement or your urine function?
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: Were your symptoms sudden or were they increasing gradually? 
Patient: They increased slowly. I had the pain killers, Medrol but, it has not been very effective. I also had that big injection in my back. It helped me for a few hours but then next day it was all same for me. 
Doctor: When did this happen? When did you get the injection? 
Patient: This was done four and a half weeks ago. 
Doctor: Okay, let me just quickly check your legs. They look full in strength, and they also seem symmetric to me. Can you raise your leg? Like straight up? 
Patient: Yeah sure. 
Doctor: Yeah, yes. Straight leg raising is also normal."

Doctor: Well, it could be anything from a joint replacement to a C section.
Doctor: Oh, no. I've never had surgery. I had all of my children naturally."
70,"Doctor: Are you taking any medication?
Patient: Yes, they have it in the chart.
Doctor: Okay, let me take a look.
Patient: Nurse just updated them.
Doctor: Yes I see Morphine, Darvocet, Flomax, Avodart and Ibuprofen. 
Patient: That's right."

Patient: No. I don't know of any family health problems."

Patient: I actually had a knee replacement at another facility, but I'd like to have another surgery.

Doctor: How is your knee doing? 
Patient: Well, my right knee is having some pain at times. 
Doctor: How are you managing this pain?

Patient: Correct.

78,"Doctor: I see here that you have a history of frequent U T I's. Are you currently experiencing any urinary symptoms?

Doctor: That's good news. Are you having other symptoms, such as fever or chills?

Guest_family: Yeah, I think her coughs trigger some sort of reflex response, causing her to spit up or throw up a few times. It comes on so suddenly, it takes me by surprise. 
Doctor: Does she happen to experience similar symptoms after her feedings? 
Guest_family: Yeah, that's new too. 
Doctor: Any diarrhea? 
Guest_family: None."
101,"Doctor: Are you taking any medication? 
Patient: Just multivitamins and calcium."
102,"Doctor: Hey what you got there?
Patient: I got this boil type of situation going on on my butt.
Doctor: Oops!
Patient: I know.
."
103,"Doctor: How's everything going on? 
Patient: I'm having this weird feeling where I feel that my face is going to twitch and I start doing these grimacing actions on my face, mouth, and then it kind of suppresses it, but I'm not sure what's happening. I'm still having a fear of feeling of pressure in the backside of my head and it comes approximately like once each week. 
Doctor: What exactly does this pressure feels like? 
Patient: It feels like pins and needles in my head and a lot of pressure and often it feels like water is running down my hair. 
Doctor: How frequent are these feelings? Is anything helping you? Are you taking any medications or anything else for it? 
Patient: It is like I said before, like once a week maybe. It has decreased from before. I am taking Aleve and it is kind of helping me. 
Doctor: Is anything else going on? 
Patient: Oh yeah, I'm still suffering from that problem of daydreaming at work and have noticed that I fall asleep when I'm sitting in front of my desk or in front of my television. I just fall asleep in non stimulating environments. It seems like I'm always tired and I cannot get enough amount of sleep no matter what I do. 
Doctor: It feels like insomnia to me, but what are your working hours? 
Patient: I work from four to midnight, and then after getting home I just, I cannot sleep. It takes me around two hours and then I wake up at nine each morning. So, it's just like I'm not getting to sleep more than five to six hours ever. Usually, it is like five hours of sleep for me.
Doctor: How is the quality of your sleep? Do you wake up many times or have sound sleep for those five hours?
Patient: It is good, I just need to get up and go to the bathroom. I think I snore, but I do not know exactly. 
Doctor: Have you ever lost your sleep to catch your breath? 
Patient: Not that I remember."
104,"Doctor: Have you ever had surgery on any of your extremities, like your arms or legs? 
Patient: Yes actually, I've had surgery on my foot, as well as my knee. 
Doctor: Good, have you had any other surgeries on anywhere else?
Patient: Now that I remember, yes, I had a tummy surgery."
105,"Doctor: Hello. It has been a long time. Nice to see you again. How can I help?
Patient: I am here for a physical. Nothing new and nothing has changed, but I think it's good to be seen once a year. 
Doctor: Great! You are absolutely right. Prevention is key. Are your social history and medical conditions the same as last visit? Here, you can look at the chart.
Patient: Yeah, that looks right. It's all the same."
106,"Doctor: Do you have any known drug allergies? 
Patient: No."
107,"Doctor: Hi, I'm the doctor that'll be treating you today. 
Patient: Hiya. Sounds good. 
Doctor: What's bringing you in? 
Patient: A big ol lump in my chest. 
Doctor: How long since you first noticed it? 
Patient: It's been there for at least a year. 
Doctor: Where on your chest? 
Patient: On the left side.
Doctor: Is it causing you pain? 
Patient: Um kind of it. It's gotten a lot more tender, and it hurts when I take deep breaths.
Doctor: Has it grown in size? 
Patient: It has. 
Doctor: And just to confirm what is in your chart, can you confirm your age, race, and gender.
Patient: Sure, I am a 56-year-old white man."
108,"Doctor: How's she doing today? 
Guest_family: She's been blowing up green snot and complaing of ear pain. 
Doctor: Both ears? 
Guest_family: Both the right and left. 
Doctor: How long has she been bringing up green snot? 
Guest_family: Maybe six or so days? 
Doctor: Let's see. It looks like she may have sinusitis. After checking both ears, I noticed fluid buildup in the right middle ear. I'll go ahead and prescribe her some antibiotics and hopefully she'll be as good as new in a few days. I'd like her to come back for a follow up to make sure all the fluid in her ear is gone."
109,"Doctor: Do you have any allergies? 
Patient: I am not allergic to anything as far as I know."
110,"Doctor: How old is the baby girl? 
Guest_family: She is two and a half years old. 
Doctor: And you both are her parents?
Guest_family: Yes. 
Doctor: Tell me what happened in detail.
Guest_family: She has a history of seizures. She used to have shakes and lose consciousness. 
Doctor: Was she taking any medications for that? 
Guest_family: Yeah, she was placed on Keppra solution one hundred and fifty M G for two times a day. It helped a lot and she was doing fine. Her seizures were improving a lot but recently we have noticed something similar again. 
Doctor: What kind of symptoms are showing now? 
Guest_family: She will just stop doing everything and stare blankly. We tried to shake her but during that period she just does not respond.
Doctor: Does she becomes floppy like can't control her body during that phase? 
Guest_family: No, we didn't notice that. 
Doctor: How long is that period? 
Guest_family2: I think it lasts somewhere around ten to fifteen seconds. 
Doctor: What are your thoughts on this? As a mother you might be spending more time with her. 
Guest_family: Yeah, I have noticed this too, but I think it stays for like three to four minutes. 
Doctor: So, it is somewhere around thirty to forty seconds.
Guest_family: One day I was outside the store and then I noticed that she had a similar event. Her skin around her mouth turned blue. 
Doctor: Was she having any kind of jerky motions?
Guest_family: No. 
Doctor: Have you changed her medications like the amount you are giving or anything like that? 
Guest_family: No, we haven't changed anything. She's still on the same dose. 
Doctor: I'm looking at the record and it says that she is supposed to take twenty M G per kilogram every day. It looks like a very low dose for her."
111,"Doctor: Do you have any major medical conditions that run in your family that I should know about? 
Patient: What do you mean by that, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, it could be anything from A D H D to substance abuse to epilepsy. 
Patient: Oh, yeah my grandfather was an alcoholic."
112,"Doctor: Is she taking any medications? 
Guest_family: Um uh I wrote them down. Let me find the Post-it note. I had it right here. 
Doctor: Take your time. 
Guest_family: Ok uh found it. 
Guest_family: It looks like she's taking some type of anxiety medication and estrogen."
113,"Doctor: And you're allergic to Sulfa drugs, correct? 
Patient: Yes, ma'am. 
Doctor: What happens when you take Sulfa drugs? 
Patient: I get incredibly dizzy and I can't stop vomiting."
114,"Doctor: And we did review your family history last time. No one else suffers from heart problems in your family, right? 
Patient: Yeah, it's just me."
115,"Doctor: So what brings you in today? 
Patient: Um I think I'm due for a checkup. While I'm here, I also wanted to figure out why I'm having so much joint pain all over. 
Doctor: When did you first notice the pain? 
Patient: It's been a couple weeks now. I thought it'd go away on its own. I've taken Advil for it, which helps a tiny bit."
116,"Doctor: Have you ever taken any prescribed drug for your headaches. 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: What do you take when you get headaches. 
Patient: I try not to take to much medication but when they get really bad, I take Excedrin or ibuprofen. 
Doctor: So only over the counter medications? Do they work in providing you relief?
Patient: Yes, I have been using over the counter medications and they have been no help with my headaches . 
Doctor: Okay."
117,"Doctor: Is this your first pregnancy? 
Patient: Yes. I'm so excited for the baby to arrive!"
118,"Doctor: Do you smoke, sir? 
Patient: No, that never appealed to me. 
Doctor: How about alcohol, do you drink? 
Patient: Nope, I don't do that either."
119,"Doctor: How many kids do you have? 
Patient: I have three kids, and I'm blessed to say that they're all healthy and well. 
Doctor: That's great to hear. Do they live with you or your ex husband? 
Patient: They live with my boyfriend and me. 
Doctor: Wonderful.  
Patient: It's a full house for sure. 
Doctor: Do you drink or smoke? 
Patient: I don't touch tobacco or any other drugs. I sometimes drink, but only on rare occasions. 
Doctor: Gotcha."
120,"Doctor: So, what's going on with your hand, miss? Is it right or left? 
Patient: It's the right one. It's been on and off and it's been happening for the last several weeks. 
Doctor: Can you elaborate what's happening? 
Patient: Sometimes I feel like a lot of pins and needles are hurting my hand while other times it is totally numb. 
Doctor: Did anything change in your daily routine? 
Patient: I don't think there have been any big changes. But after I started having these episodes of numbness and tingling, I moved my keyboard down at work. I just hope that it will help. I was just worried if I had carpal tunnel. 
Doctor: What does a normal day look like? What is it like at work? 
Patient: I have a typical office job. I sit in front of the computer for eight hours and mostly work on a keyboard. I hardly take two coffee breaks in between and a lunch break. It is the same kind of thing I'm doing again and again every day. 
Doctor: Is it the same day or night? 
Patient: Oh, it is bad at night, how I'm sleeping. If I sleep in a certain way, then I will wake up with a lot of tingling. Then I must literally shake my hands out to get rid of this tingling. It's just-- it's all so much an it irritates me that it's affecting my mental health.
Doctor: Is it in your whole hand or some specific fingers? 
Patient: It is mostly in my middle finger, but sometimes I also get this on the first or the second finger of my right hand. Sometimes I have pain in my thumb as well. Do you think it is arthritis? 
Doctor: I don't think so. But we can get a test done to confirm it if you want."
121,"Doctor: Are you still take Prevacid? 
Patient: No. I had to stop taking it.  It gave me diarrhea."
122,"Guest_family: They just changed his P bag, that's why there is no pee in it.
Doctor: Okay. Yes, it looks empty. I think they did a straight cath.
Guest_family: Yeah, and they took out the urine to send it to the lab.
Doctor: Okay. Yes, there were no leukocyte seen. That means no infection.
Guest_family: But they said there was blood?
Doctor: Yes, during catheterization but the urine is normal.
Guest_family: Okay.
Doctor: In your x ray there was stool seen in the colon.
Guest_family: Okay.
Guest_family_2: He is fine?
Doctor: Yeah, he is fine. I can see that he is very active. Jumping up and down.
Doctor: Hi champ!
Patient: Hi."
123,"Doctor: Is there any relevant medical history or medical issues going on in your family in present or in past? 
Patient: No, nothing that I could remember. 
Doctor: Do you drink or smoke? 
Patient: Nope."
124,"Guest_clinician: How's the patient doing? 
Doctor: In stable condition, but I'm not yet able to obtain a history from them. 
Guest_clinician: Please page me when they're awake and able to answer questions. I'll be on the eighth floor if you need me. 
Doctor: Will do."
125,"Patient: I just had few questions. Can you tell me about my diagnosis?
Doctor: Sure. It's called Serotonin syndrome, ma'am. After careful evaluation of your labs, we found out that your white count and C P K was high, and those abnormalities lined up with serotonin syndrome. What are you experiencing right now?
Patient: I have been very restless and easily agitated, I have diarrhea. But no fever or shakiness.
Doctor: These can match serotonin syndrome as well. You deny any fever, tremor or hypperflexia so we will give you some IV fluids and I will check on you in an hour or so.
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: Looks like your C P K counts improved with I V fluids and after discontinuing Prozac.
Patient: How are the counts now? Are they normal? Because I feel normal.
Doctor: Yes, your C P K and white blood cell counts have come back down. Almost normal now.
Patient: My husband left me two weeks ago. My panic attacks are increasing day by day.
Doctor: Okay, I see that you have a history of panic attacks and you do have depression and anxiety, is that correct? Last Friday, I talked to psychiatrist about your issues, and he recommended Cymbalta as an alternative to Prozac. 
Patient: Yes, I stopped taking Prozac, and I am going to see him on Monday or Tuesday. I have a counselor too.
Patient: I do think it will be difficult to go home alone but my daughter is coming to visit me in two weeks.
Doctor: Oh wow.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: That's nice. Do you have someone who can drop you home and help you?
Patient: Yes, I have a friend who does that, I am staying with her for next three days.
Doctor: Okay that sounds good. Just continue with your medications for high blood pressure and diabetes as well. So, we treated your imbalance issues and gave you IV fluids, you do not have any more diarrhea, right?
Patient: Yes, that's right."
126,"Doctor: Welcome to the clinic, miss. 
Patient: Thank you. 
Doctor: What brings you to the clinic today? 
Patient: I am concerned that I have been having small seizures again. 
Doctor: Do you have a history of epilepsy? 
Patient: Yes, I do. I also have had non epileptic issues in the past. 
Doctor: Okay. What makes you feel like you are having seizures again? 
Patient: In the mornings I have been waking up with strange body aches and feeling confused. I have felt these feelings before after having seizures in the past. I live alone now so I don't know if I had a seizure or not. 
Doctor: Okay. Do you have weakness when you wake up? 
Patient: Yes. It also happens while I am at work at my desk. I work alone in my office most of the day so no one is around to notice what might be happening. 
Doctor: Okay. That is good to know. How old are you? 
Patient: I am forty six.  
Doctor: Okay. I would like to perform a video E E G today. By doing the video E E G we will have more information on whether you are having epileptic seizures or non-epileptic events. 
Patient: Yes. Let's do that. 
Doctor: Do you have time for us to do it today? 
Patient: Yes. I took the whole day off work so we can do it now.

128,"Doctor: We are following up with you for your prostate cancer which has metastasized to your bladder and in several locations throughout your body including the spine and shoulder.
Patient: Yes, you remember I had blood in my urine in the past, but I think it is coming back. I started noticing that from yesterday, and today I saw a lot of blood with very little urine.
Doctor: Oh okay, we will have to evaluate that then. Let me ask you few other questions to get this out of the way. How about your back pain, how's it? Also any incontinence?
Patient:  Okay sure. No, there is no change in my chronic lower back pain, and no, no incontinence, urinary or stool. 
Doctor: All right. How about fever, belly pain, nausea or vomiting?
Patient: No to everything.
Doctor: Are you able to pee noramally and pass urine, you aren't retaining? How about blood in stools?
Patient: Yes, I am passing everything well. No blood in stools.
Doctor: Okay. Can you tell me if you have finished your chemo?
Patient: Yes, I have already completed chemo. Now they started me with radiation therapy, but it is only targeted to the bones. They told me I will feel well as in there won't be any pain. It's not supposed to treat or cure the cancer, but just to make me comfortable.
Doctor: Yes, we are looking at that at this point.
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: Do you have any hospice care facility listed?
Patient:  No, I haven't looked at it yet, but I would love to look at hospice facilities.
Doctor: That treatment management we are focusing on-
Patient: I know only comfort ha!"

Patient: Yeah, I am. I've been having some problems on my right side under my ribs.

Patient: Yeah, that's fine. 
Doctor: Great. I see you had a history of hives before, right? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct.

Patient: I think I had that for two years.  
Doctor: I see. You also have high blood pressure, right? 
Patient: Yeah, I do. 
Doctor: Hm. They might associate your kidney problems with high blood pressure. Let's take a closer look."
130,"Doctor: Looks like he has a foreign body in his left eye. 
Guest_family: Does he need to see an eye doctor after this?"
131,"Doctor: His fever is running very high, I think he is having a febrile seizure.

Guest_family: No, I don't. It starts with a J. I can find a picture. 
Guest_family: Here it is. It's this oil.

Patient: Not that I know."
141,"Patient: So, as you remember I was working with a patient and I accidently jammed that needle inside me.

Guest_family: Good morning to you too, doctor. Well, he's about five and a half now, and he broke both the bones in his forearm in September of two thousand seven. 
Doctor: How did the fracture heal? Generally, children heal very well. 
Guest_family: Well, yes, until he also rebroke it about a month ago. 
Doctor: Yes, I see now, there's an ulnar nail pretty prominently visible under the skin, did he have surgery for this? 
Guest_family: Yes, about a month ago now. Should we remove the nail?
Doctor: We'll have to, even though its early.
Guest_family: What will we do after the nail is removed? 
Doctor: After that, we'll put him back in a cast for about another three weeks. We'll evaluate him and see how he's doing.  
Guest_family: Okay. What are the risks of infection for this surgery?
Doctor: The risk of infection is overall very low, honestly its less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, or need for longer casting. I would not worry too much about these risks. I have not seen anything bad happen before.
Guest_family_1: Will he be asleep for the surgery?
Doctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing."
147,"Doctor: Does she take any medicine? 
Guest_family: Um, let me check. She usually keeps them in her purse. Okay, so here we have three medicine bottles. The labels are all in Spanish, but I can translate for you. She takes one Aspirin a day along with her blood pressure and diabetes medicine. 
Doctor: Do you mind if I take a look as well? 
Guest_family: Sure, here you go."

Guest_family: No, not really, he's been doing pretty well. "

Guest_family: It is higher at night.
Doctor: Have you checked it?
Guest_family: Yes, it was one o two point six for two days. I have not checked it since then. But isn't it strange just when I thought to bring him to the doctor, he is better.
