Doctor: Hi there! It is good to see you both. How has everything been going for the both of you? 
Patient: Hi Doctor.  
Guest_family: Things have been pretty good. She has been having some new emotional outbursts. I made an appointment with the down syndrome behavioral specialist that you recommended from the last time we were here.  
Doctor: That is great. Keep me updated on her progress.  Her bloodwork came back showing an underactive thyroid. This explains the recent weight gain and fatigue. I would like to start her on a medication called levothyroxine. We will need to check her bloodwork again in one month to see how her thyroid respond to the medication. 
Guest_family: Okay.  
Doctor: Is there any other concerns you have today? 
Guest_family: Yes. She has this toenail that looks strange and discolored.  
Doctor: Let me look. Can you remove your socks for me? 
Patient: Yes.  
Doctor: Is it this nail? 
Guest_family: Yes.  
Doctor: This is very common. It is called Onychomycosis. It is nail fungus. Since only one nail is affected, I would recommend starting off with a topical treatment. I will send the drops to your pharmacy. You will put on drop on the affected nail, daily.

Doctor: Oh yes, it is because you got something called as acute cystitis and its usually very painful and can cause some serious complications. 
Patient: Well, is it because of my diabetes?
Doctor: I am afraid I don't have better news for you, but your diabetes is out of control. It's way too high and you must be really careful. Are you taking your medicines?
Patient: Yes!
Doctor: How bout diet?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes I don't care about my diet.
Doctor: Well, you must watch your diet, you can't just be careless. I am going to change your diabetes medication. And let's start you on the antibiotic that should give you relief. Also stay hydrated drink plenty of fluids it will help you flush the infection out.
