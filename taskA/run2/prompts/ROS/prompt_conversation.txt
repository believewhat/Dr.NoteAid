Your Notes:
As mentioned denies any oropharyngeal swelling.  No lip or tongue swelling.  No wheezing or shortness of breath.  No headache.  No nausea.  Notes itchy rash, especially on his torso and upper arms.

Conversation you could generate:
Doctor: Hey, bud. What brings you in today? 
Patient: A rash on my upper arms and torso. 
Doctor: When did it start? 
Patient: Bout a day or two ago. 
Doctor: Any itchiness to the area? 
Patient: Yes, a lot actually. 
Doctor: Have you had episodes of shortness of breath or wheezing? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: How about swelling to your lips, tongue, or throat?

Patient: No. 
Doctor: Have you applied anything to the rash?
