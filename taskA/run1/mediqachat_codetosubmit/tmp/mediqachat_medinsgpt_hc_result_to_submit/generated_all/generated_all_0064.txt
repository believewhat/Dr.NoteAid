dialogue:
Doctor: How're you feeling today? 
Patient: Honestly, I've had way better days. 
Doctor: I'm sorry. Why is that? 
Patient: I've been getting short of breath a lot more than I'm used to. 
Doctor: How long has this been going on? 
Patient: Past three days. 
Doctor: Are you experiencing any leg pain or swelling? 
Patient: Eh no.  
Doctor: How about chest pain or anything like it? 
Patient: No to that either. 
Doctor: I must say, this is concerning. I'd like you to get a C T scan of your chest so we can see what's going on. For now, your pulse ox is in the high nineties so you won't be needing supplemental oxygen at this moment in time. Do you notice the shortness of breath getting worse when you're moving around? 
Patient: Yeah, mostly when I exert myself. 
Doctor: Okay, I see. And the frequency by which your're short of breath is new for you, correct? 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: Do you happen to have a history of asthma? 
Patient: No asthma.
