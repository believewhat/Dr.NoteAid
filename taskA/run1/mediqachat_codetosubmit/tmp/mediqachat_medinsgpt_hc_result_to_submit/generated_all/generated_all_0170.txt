dialogue:
Doctor: Hello nurse, who do we have here today?
Guest_clinician: This is a thirty-seven-year-old, left-handed male. He visited us one month ago for headaches, nausea, and vomiting. His exams from that time showed no evidence of bowel obstruction and he was released home.
Doctor: Was there any improvement after your discharge, sir?
Patient: No, I had the same symptoms on and off after that. 
Doctor: What problems are you facing now?
Patient: I am seeing things blurred and having difficulty concentrating. My headaches are worse when sitting up. I notice them first thing in the morning. 
Doctor: How would you describe your headaches? 
Patient: They're dull, constant, and it feels like as if my head is wrapped in a tight band. 
Doctor: Your headache starts from which part of your head? 
Patient: It normally starts on the forehead and then it kind of goes to the back. It happens like six times a day. Lying down or putting my head down between my knees helps.
Doctor: What else do you feel along with your headaches? 
Patient: Like I told the Nurse here before, I get blurry eyesight, nausea and there is vomiting. Any kind of bright light hurts. I'm just afraid of loud sounds. 
Guest_clinician: I discussed with him about any blind spots, positive visual phenomena, weakness, numbness, tingling or double vision or any speech disorder, but he denies everything.
Doctor: How about your weight? 
Patient: It has been going up and down like for over past three months. I was one hundred and sixty three and then I know it was one hundred and forty eight at a point. 
Guest_clinician: Today his weight is one hundred and fifty four pounds.
Doctor: How are you eating habits in the last, let's say, one month? 
Patient: It has been bad. I don't feel like eating anymore. Looks like I have lost my appetite.
