Doctor: How old is the baby girl? 
Guest_family: She is two and a half years old. 
Doctor: And you both are her parents?
Guest_family: Yes. 
Doctor: Tell me what happened in detail.
Guest_family: She has a history of seizures. She used to have shakes and lose consciousness. 
Doctor: Was she taking any medications for that? 
Guest_family: Yeah, she was placed on Keppra solution one hundred and fifty M G for two times a day. It helped a lot and she was doing fine. Her seizures were improving a lot but recently we have noticed something similar again. 
Doctor: What kind of symptoms are showing now? 
Guest_family: She will just stop doing everything and stare blankly. We tried to shake her but during that period she just does not respond.
Doctor: Does she becomes floppy like can't control her body during that phase? 
Guest_family: No, we didn't notice that. 
Doctor: How long is that period? 
Guest_family2: I think it lasts somewhere around ten to fifteen seconds. 
Doctor: What are your thoughts on this? As a mother you might be spending more time with her. 
Guest_family: Yeah, I have noticed this too, but I think it stays for like three to four minutes. 
Doctor: So, it is somewhere around thirty to forty seconds.
Guest_family: One day I was outside the store and then I noticed that she had a similar event. Her skin around her mouth turned blue. 
Doctor: Was she having any kind of jerky motions?
Guest_family: No. 
Doctor: Have you changed her medications like the amount you are giving or anything like that? 
Guest_family: No, we haven't changed anything. She's still on the same dose. 
Doctor: I'm looking at the record and it says that she is supposed to take twenty M G per kilogram every day. It looks like a very low dose for her.
