Doctor: Are you noting your readings? Did you bring it with you?
Patient: No. I did not get the readings with me but I assure you I am taking care and my B P is normal.
Doctor: Well, it's up and I am little bothered by it.

Doctor: I completely understand. It's never easy to see your baby sick. Have you taken her temperature recently? 
Guest_family: Yes, I've been using an anal thermometer. She's been running a fever for the past two days. 
Doctor: I'm glad you brought her in today. I'll go ahead and take her temperature again. Is she experiencing any other symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or wheezing at all? 
Guest_family: Not that we've noticed. 
Doctor: Is she taking down milk?

Guest_family: Hm three or four times. I should've kept better track.
