Doctor: Good afternoon, and who is this with you today? 
Patient: This is my power of attorney, doctor. 
Doctor: Do you have any major medical conditions that I should know about, ma'am? 
Patient: Well, I'm fifty five, and I've had a stroke. 
Doctor: Okay, thank you. So, what brings you in for a visit today?
Patient: I have the urge to use the bathroom all the time. 
Doctor: Do you ever pee on yourself because of this? 
Patient: I have. 
Doctor: Has this problem been getting worse? 
Patient: Yes, it has been recently. 
Doctor: What medications have you taken for this? 
Patient: I've had VESIcare, but it hasn't improved yet. I'm taking Enablex right now. 
Doctor: Have you had any improvement with that? 
Patient: No, not yet. 
Doctor: Has the nursing home done a voiding diary? 
Patient: No, they haven't done that either. 
Doctor: Are you having any blood in the urine, or pain with urination? 
Patient: No, thankfully I'm not. 
Doctor: How about fever or chills?
Patient: No, none of that either? 
Doctor: What about bowel issues? 
Patient: No, but I go through several pairs of Depends a day. 
Doctor: Okay, and I'm looking at the results of your urodynamics from April of two thousand eight, which we did in the office. 
Patient: What does that show, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, it shows significant detrusor instability with involuntary urinary incontinence and low bladder volumes, and the cystoscopy was unremarkable, which is good.
