Doctor: Good afternoon, sir, did you just have your forty first birthday? 
Patient: Yes, I just had it. 
Doctor: Happy birthday! Just to confirm my charts, you identify as White, correct? 
Patient: Yes, doctor. That's correct. 
Doctor: Great, thank you. So, we've treated you for H I V in the past. I have your lab results from your last visit right here.
Patient: Can you tell me those numbers again, doctor? 
Doctor: Absolutely, your C D 4 count was four hundred twenty five, your viral load was less than fifty, and that was in August of two thousand seven. 
Patient: Are those normal? 
Doctor: Both of those are low, actually, but the low viral load is good. 
Patient: Oh, that's good, I guess. 
Doctor: Have you had any medical complications recently? 
Patient: Well, I was in the hospital recently. 
Doctor: What was that for? 
Patient: I had an abscess in my left glute, so I had a surgery to remove and clean it out. 
Doctor: How is the abscess today? 
Patient: It's getting better, I follow up with the surgeon today after this appointment. 
Doctor: Good, what about your medical history?
Patient: I have high blood pressure and high triglyceride levels. 
Doctor: Okay, thank you. What about newly diagnosed conditions?   
Patient: Well, I got diagnosed with diabetes too. 
Doctor: What symptoms have you been experiencing with your diabetes? 
Patient: Well, I've been peeing a lot, and I've been really thirsty, too. 
Doctor: How have you been treated for this to date? 
Patient: Um, I saw the endocrinologists while I was in the hospital, and they gave me insulin. 
Doctor: Are you still taking the insulin? 
Patient: No, I can't afford to pay for it. So, they gave me Glucophage and, um, glyburide. 
Doctor: Have you been taking these? 
Patient: Yes, exactly as instructed. 
Doctor: Good, and how do you feel today? 
Patient: Overall, I'd say I'm feeling better.
