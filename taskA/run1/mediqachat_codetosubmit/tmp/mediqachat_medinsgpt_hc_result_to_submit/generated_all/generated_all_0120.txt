dialogue:
Doctor: So, what's going on with your hand, miss? Is it right or left? 
Patient: It's the right one. It's been on and off and it's been happening for the last several weeks. 
Doctor: Can you elaborate what's happening? 
Patient: Sometimes I feel like a lot of pins and needles are hurting my hand while other times it is totally numb. 
Doctor: Did anything change in your daily routine? 
Patient: I don't think there have been any big changes. But after I started having these episodes of numbness and tingling, I moved my keyboard down at work. I just hope that it will help. I was just worried if I had carpal tunnel. 
Doctor: What does a normal day look like? What is it like at work? 
Patient: I have a typical office job. I sit in front of the computer for eight hours and mostly work on a keyboard. I hardly take two coffee breaks in between and a lunch break. It is the same kind of thing I'm doing again and again every day. 
Doctor: Is it the same day or night? 
Patient: Oh, it is bad at night, how I'm sleeping. If I sleep in a certain way, then I will wake up with a lot of tingling. Then I must literally shake my hands out to get rid of this tingling. It's just-- it's all so much an it irritates me that it's affecting my mental health.
Doctor: Is it in your whole hand or some specific fingers? 
Patient: It is mostly in my middle finger, but sometimes I also get this on the first or the second finger of my right hand. Sometimes I have pain in my thumb as well. Do you think it is arthritis? 
Doctor: I don't think so. But we can get a test done to confirm it if you want.
