Doctor: How old are you? 
Patient: Fifty six. 
Doctor: Are you right handed or left handed? 
Patient: I'm right handed.
Doctor: So, you have this long standing on and off lower back pain on your right side. And it all happened after your motor vehicle accident in September of two thousand and five. 
Patient: That's right. Right after accident. At that time, I did not feel anything, but five days later I started getting this abnormal like pain in the lower side of my back, especially on the right side. It kind of like moved from there to my buttocks on the posterior side on my thigh and on outside of my calf. 
Doctor: Does anything elevate your pain or decreases it? 
Patient: It gets worse when I'm sitting for a longer period, such as like driving or if I'm walking for a long period of time. It is a little less bad when walking, but still, it is there. Lying down relieves the pain for a bit and also standing helps. 
Doctor: Is there any symptom like weakness or pain in your left leg or your right leg? 
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: Any change in your bowel movement or your urine function?
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: Were your symptoms sudden or were they increasing gradually? 
Patient: They increased slowly. I had the pain killers, Medrol but, it has not been very effective. I also had that big injection in my back. It helped me for a few hours but then next day it was all same for me. 
Doctor: When did this happen? When did you get the injection? 
Patient: This was done four and a half weeks ago. 
Doctor: Okay, let me just quickly check your legs. They look full in strength, and they also seem symmetric to me. Can you raise your leg? Like straight up? 
Patient: Yeah sure. 
Doctor: Yeah, yes. Straight leg raising is also normal.
