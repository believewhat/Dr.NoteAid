Doctor: How's she doing today?

Doctor: Both ears? 
Guest_family: Both the right and left. 
Doctor: How long has she been bringing up green snot? 
Guest_family: Maybe six or so days? 
Doctor: Let's see. It looks like she may have sinusitis. After checking both ears, I noticed fluid buildup in the right middle ear.
