Doctor: Good afternoon, ma'am. 
Patient: Good afternoon, doctor. 
Doctor: Before we begin, how old are you?
Patient: I'm fifty seven years old. 
Doctor: Very well, and what seems to be the problem today? 
Patient: So, I had surgery on these feet, um, like thirteen years ago to remove bunions, but they're back now. 
Doctor: I see, are these bunions present on both feet? 
Patient: Yeah, they are. 
Doctor: Is one foot worse than the other? 
Patient: Yeah, my right foot is worse than the left. 
Doctor: Is the pain getting worse?
Patient: Yes, and I'm so uncomfortable. 
Doctor: On the right foot, do you have any other pain? Or is it just because of the bunion? 
Patient: Well, I have some pain here, and here. 
Doctor: Okay, just so you know, these are the second toe, and M T P joint. This is where you're feeling the pain, right?
Patient: Yes, it hurts so bad there. 
Doctor: There's some deformity here at the second toe as well. 
Patient: Yes, I see what you're talking about. 
Doctor: Going back to that surgery thirteen years ago, did you heal up well?
Patient: Since that surgery this bunion has slowly been coming back. 
Doctor: I see. 
Patient: Please, look at my left foot, do those toes look strange to you?
Doctor: Yes, you have that deformity in the second and third toes of the left foot as well. 
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means you have some arthritis in these toes. What do you do for a living?
Patient: I see. I work in the hospital.
Doctor: Can I assume you're on your feet all day for work?
Patient: Yes, I have to stand all day every day. 
Doctor: Do you wear supports, or any kind of orthotics? 
Patient: Yes, I wear orthotics. 
Doctor: Do those provide any relief? 
Patient: They definitely give me some relief, but I'm still in so much pain.
