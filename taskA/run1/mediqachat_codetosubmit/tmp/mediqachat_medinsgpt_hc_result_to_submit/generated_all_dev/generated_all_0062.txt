Patient: I did some. It was helping me with my neck pain. But this right hand is still feeling weak. I feel it is difficult at times to open jars and open doors. Many times, I drop items. 
Doctor: Is it happening with both hands or one is more than the other? 
Patient: Right side is giving me more problems than the left. 
Doctor: Anything else that you noticed? 
Patient: Yeah, one more thing I noticed is that sometimes when I am sleeping in the night, I feel this sharp shooting pain and weakness. It goes down my left side of upper, I mean, whole hand and I feel scared after that.
