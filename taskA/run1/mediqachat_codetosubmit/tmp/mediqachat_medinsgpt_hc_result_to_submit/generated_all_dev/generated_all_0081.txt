Doctor: I hear someone just had a birthday! How young are you now, ma'am? 
Patient: Hello, doctor. I just turned fifty eight. 
Doctor: That's wonderful. You identify as white as well, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: Is this right knee still bothering you?
Patient: Yes, and it's been going on for years now. 
Doctor: I've done two arthroscopies on this knee, right? 
Patient: Yeah, that's right.
Doctor: How have you handled conservative treatment? 
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: Well, that's the antiinflammatories, rest, and changes in activity you've been advised to do.
Patient: Honestly, there's been no improvement. 
Doctor: Okay, and I'm looking at your images, and they show collapsing type valgus degenerative osteoarthritis, and there's complete collapse and wear of the lateral compartment and degenerative changes noted to the femoral sulcus. 
Patient: Okay, I need you to explain that for me, doctor. 
Doctor: In summary, you have a pretty significant amount of arthritis in this knee. 
Patient: Lateral compartment, that's the outside of the knee, right? 
Doctor: Yes, that's correct. Your medial, or inside part of the knee, looks much better comparatively, but there's still some arthritis. 
Patient: Okay, thank you. 
Doctor: Are you able to flex and extend the knee all the way?
Patient: Yes, look. 
Doctor: Can I test your stability? Okay, yes, there's some laxity here on both sides of the knee.
