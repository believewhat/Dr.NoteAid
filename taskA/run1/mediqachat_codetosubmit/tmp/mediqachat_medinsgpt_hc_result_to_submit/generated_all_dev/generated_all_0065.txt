Doctor: Oh, that's bad! How did you hurt your right hand?
Patient: Ah, I punched that other guy in face or maybe his mouth, I don't remember exactly but he got a good one. Later, in anger I punched in a glass. It broke the glass and spilled all the drink. I think I got a cut as it was bleeding badly. 
Doctor: I see three cuts in your right hand. 
Doctor: When you came here in Emergency your wound was clean and looked like somebody tried to fix your cut. Do you remember any details about it?
Patient: Yeah, I remember there was a navy corpsman. He was very helpful; he cleaned my cut with the tap water. He also tried to close it up with gauze and superglue. He said it will stop bleeding, but nothing helped. They called for help and here I am in emergency.
