{"id": "11", "section_header": "history of present illness", "section_text": "The patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.", "dialogue": "Doctor: I hear someone has a birthday coming up, how old are you turning, ma'am?\nPatient: I'll be ninety later this month, doctor. \nDoctor: You're here for a follow up not very long after your first visit. What seems to be the problem today? \nPatient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. \nDoctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? \nPatient: No, I'm not taking that right now. \nDoctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? \nPatient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. \nDoctor: That was one M G per day, correct? \nPatient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. \nDoctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. \nPatient: What is this for, doctor? \nDoctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. \nPatient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. \nGuest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. \nDoctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?\nPatient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. \nDoctor: Did you have x rays taken today? \nPatient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. \nDoctor: Good, I have the images right here. \nPatient: What do they show, doctor?\nDoctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. \nPatient: What makes you think there's an injury? \nDoctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? \nPatient: No, none. \nDoctor: Then we won't worry about it. \nPatient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.\nDoctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? \nPatient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. \nDoctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? \nPatient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. \nDoctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?\nPatient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? \nDoctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? \nPatient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. \nDoctor: Do they come and go, the sores? \nPatient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. \nDoctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. \nPatient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. \nDoctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? \nPatient: Yes, we think so."}

I believe that's where most of her symptoms, if not all, are stemming from. \nGuest_family: Does that mean she'll need surgery? \nDoctor: We'll have to see, but chances are higher since she's experiencing symptoms due to her thyroid. \nGuest_family: When will we find out? \nDoctor: I'd like to get some imaging done and see if we can get a consult in first."}

He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back.  The patient said he primarily landed on the left side.  After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated.  He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital.  At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan.  The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found.  It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma.  Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005.  The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments.  Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ.  She ordered an MRI of his neck.  Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned.

As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.", "dialogue": "Doctor: Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today? \nPatient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. \nDoctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? \nPatient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? \nDoctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. \nPatient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? \nPatient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.\nDoctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? \nPatient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. \nDoctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? \nPatient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? \nDoctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. \nPatient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. \nDoctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? \nPatient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. \nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \nPatient: That's reassuring. \nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  \nPatient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. \nDoctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?\nPatient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. \nDoctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? \nPatient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. \nDoctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? \nPatient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. \nDoctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? \nPatient: Yeah, I did. \nDoctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. \nPatient: Sounds good. \nDoctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. \nPatient: Oh, wow.

Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.

Her balance has also gradually declined such that she frequently touches walls and furniture to stabilize herself.  She has difficulty stepping up on to things like a scale because of this imbalance.  She does not festinate.  Her husband has noticed some slowing of her speed.  She does not need to use an assistive device.  She has occasional difficulty getting in and out of a car.  Recently she has had more frequent falls.  In March of 2007, she fell when she was walking to the bedroom and broke her wrist.  Since that time, she has not had any emergency room trips, but she has had other falls. With respect to her bowel and bladder, she has no issues and no trouble with frequency or urgency. The patient does not have headaches.

He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm.  It occurs on a daily basis.  He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers.  There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm. He has had a 30-year history of neck pain.  He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain.  This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes.  He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain.  He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007.  When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain.  He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase.  He is taking multiple other pain medications.

I saw someone for it in two thousand and six, and then I developed this ear pain. They could not figure out what was going on so eventually I was sent to have an M R I of my neck and upper spine, which showed some degenerative changes. Then I was referred to Doctor X who was treating me for neck pain.  He gave me steroid injections. \nDoctor: Are you still seeing Doctor X for the epidural injections? \nPatient: Yes. I have been seeing him since two thousand and seven. \nDoctor: How old are you?\nPatient: I am fifty eight. \nDoctor: Are you experiencing any symptoms from receiving the injections? \nPatient: Those are for neck pain.

When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? \nGuest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected.

Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.

{"id": "870", "section_header": "history of present illness", "section_text": "The patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment. The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night. The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night. As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed. In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures. He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.  He generally works from 8 to 8:30 a.m. until approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m.  He is involved in training purpose to how to sell managed funds and accounts. The patient reports no change in daytime stamina.  He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours. The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.", "dialogue": "Doctor: Hello, sir how can I help you? Looks like we are talking about snoring today.\nPatient: Yeah, I need to get this loud and obnoxious snoring under control. I keep waking up my partner. I have a C P A P right now because I was told I have almost severe sleep apnea.  \nDoctor: Yes, I see on your chart that you were given ten centimeters of H two O nasal pressure and that you predominately suffer from hypopnea. Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?\nPatient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. \nDoctor: So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?\nPatient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still. \nDoctor: That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of. \nPatient: Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring. \nDoctor: How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?\nPatient: I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night. I may get a little tired during hay fever season, but that is rare. \nDoctor: Yes, I see that you have hay fever. Fatigue is a common symptom from the allergy."}

Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.

He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.  No further problems have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring.", "dialogue": "Doctor: Hello, sir. I see you're being seen for an evaluation for your allergy. Can you please confirm your age?\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. Thirty four.\nDoctor: Let me take a look at your medical records. I see you were treated at the A B C Medical Center for an allergic reaction, correct? \nPatient: Yeah. I was rushed to the hospital that day. After, they told me to get checked for a follow up. \nDoctor: Who told you to have a follow up? \nPatient: One of the E R doctors and the kidney doctor. \nDoctor: I see. Your records indicate you had some swelling around the eye on May third of two thousand and eight. The cause was unknown. I see you were transferred from A B C Medical Center to X Y Z Medical center that day. \nPatient: Yeah, that sounds about right. Were there more details about that? \nDoctor: Yeah, there is. It says here you have a history of renal failure, so you needed dialysis. They believe the allergic reaction was due to this medicine called, Keflex, which was used during your dialysis treatment. Does that name ring a bell? \nPatient: Yeah, it does. I forgot why they gave it to me.  \nDoctor: Usually, Keflex is used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection. \nPatient: Oh, I see. \nDoctor: I would like to ask you more about your allergies. What would you say you're allergic to? \nPatient: I've had a lot of problems with grass and sometimes pollen. \nDoctor: I see. I'll put that down as grass allergies, and environmental and inhalant allergies. Do you have any life-threatening allergic reactions? \nPatient: Nope. Never had that. \nDoctor: Have you ever had any swelling under the skin due to something you ate or touched? \nPatient: Nope. Never had that either. \nDoctor: That's great. I'm taking a look at your medications. I see you aren't taking anything for your allergies, but you are taking Atenolol. Do you have high blood pressure? \nPatient: Yeah, I do. \nDoctor: I see. All that's left from your report are the treatments they gave you before you were discharged from the hospital. \nPatient: What were the treatments they gave me? \nDoctor: Looks like they monitored you the whole time and gave you some corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy. You didn't have any additional problems as well."}

What brought you to our dermatology department today?\nPatient: I'm having pain in my stomach on the right side and down here. \nDoctor: Is it only on the right side or anywhere else? \nPatient: It is on both sides and now I can feel it on the middle part of my left thigh as well.\nDoctor: Tell me more about it. How did it start? When did you first notice it? \nPatient: It's been going on and off. It was not there for a while, but now it is like back again mainly on my tummy, down here. It is painful when I touch it. At first, I thought maybe I'm having shingles.\nDoctor: When did you notice it? \nPatient: It all started before the holidays, I think one and a half months before the holidays. It is still going on for the past eight days in my tummy and the hips mainly on the right side.\nDoctor: Did you get any treatment for this? Any over the counter medicines?\nPatient: No, as I told you I thought it was shingles, but then there was no change in the skin, no rashes, nothing. I was not sure what to take.\nDoctor: Okay, do you bathe every day?\nPatient: Yes, I do but I try to use as little soap as possible. \nDoctor: Okay, here is what I think, all your symptoms are pointing towards hyperesthesia. I would like to run some tests to find the underlying cause and then we will start the treatment. A nurse will come and take you to the lab. Does this sound good to you?\nPatient: Yes."}

On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between.  She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.

I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?\nPatient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  \nDoctor: Is there any instability? \nPatient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. \nDoctor: Are you working right now?\nPatient: No, I'm not right now. \nDoctor: Any allergies I should know about? \nPatient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. \nDoctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?\nPatient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. \nDoctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? \nPatient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. \nDoctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? \nPatient: Yeah, it does occasionally. \nDoctor: Does anything make this feel better?\nPatient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated. \nDoctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average? \nPatient: Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too. \nDoctor: What about at its worst?\nPatient: Easily, its ten out of ten. \nDoctor: Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?\nPatient: Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten. I also have this other M R I report from September of O six, here. \nDoctor: Thanks. I see. They said that there is nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but there is no acute fracture or any ligament abnormalities. That's good."}

{"id": "1115", "section_header": "history of present illness", "section_text": "This is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.", "dialogue": "Doctor: Hello, miss. Doctor X and I will be going over your medical history with you. Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?\nPatient: I'm twenty five years old. \nDoctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?\nDoctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. \nDoctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? \nDoctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.\nDoctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? \nDoctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? \nPatient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.\nDoctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? \nDoctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. \nDoctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. \nDoctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. \nDoctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? \nDoctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. \nDoctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? \nDoctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. \nDoctor: Could you explain what it says?\nDoctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. \nDoctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? \nDoctor_2: That is correct. \nDoctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? \nDoctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. \nDoctor: What lupus serologies were used? \nDoctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. \nDoctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? \nDoctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. \nDoctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? \nDoctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. \nDoctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. \nDoctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?\nDoctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. \nDoctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?\nDoctor_2: That's correct. \nDoctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? \nPatient: I tried my best to. \nDoctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.\nDoctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?\nDoctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. \nDoctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? \nDoctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. \nDoctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? \nDoctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. \nDoctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. \nPatient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. \nDoctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?\nDoctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. \nDoctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? \nDoctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. \nDoctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?\nDoctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. \nDoctor: What was she places on after?\nDoctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. \nDoctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? \nDoctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? \nPatient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. \nDoctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? \nDoctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. \nDoctor: Did they find anything apparent? \nDoctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. \nDoctor: What was the plan following that? \nDocotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. \nDoctor: Was there any medication prescribed? \nDoctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. \nDoctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? \nDoctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \nDoctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. \nPatient: I see. Did you find anything else? \nDoctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?\nDoctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. \nDoctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? \nPatient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. \nDoctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? \nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. \nDoctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? \nPatient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. \nDoctor: When did you notice the rashes? \nPatient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. \nDoctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? \nPatient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. \nDoctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? \nPatient: That's correct. \nDoctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? \nPatient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. \nDoctor: I'll discus that with you right now. \nPatient: Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow."}

{"id": "1198", "section_header": "history of present illness", "section_text": "This patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.", "dialogue": "Doctor: How are you doing today, sir? \nPatient: Honestly, I'm pretty sick today. I've got a lot going on. \nDoctor: How long have you been feeling this way?\nPatient: Well, it's been off and on for about a month now. \nDoctor: Has it been getting worse recently? \nPatient: Yeah, it has over the last couple weeks. \nDoctor: What are your symptoms? \nPatient: Well, I'm coughing up this yellow phlegm. It feels like everything is in my chest. \nDoctor: What medications have you been taking for this?\nPatient: I've been taking Allegra D sometimes, but I'm almost out. I need a refill. \nDoctor: What other problems are you having? \nPatient: My foot keeps breaking out. \nDoctor: Has this improved at all? \nPatient: Well, it was for a while, but now it's really bad again. \nDoctor: Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before? \nPatient: I had, um, tinea pedis before. \nDoctor: How was this treated?\nPatient: They gave me Nizoral cream.\nDoctor: It has been getting warmer recently, I don't think that this isn't necessarily a coincidence that you're having these symptoms now.\nPatient: Yeah, I work in the flint and it's really hot and humid down there.  \nDoctor: What else are you dealing with, sir? \nPatient: I have this wart on my right middle finger, are you able to freeze it off? \nDoctor: Have you ever done that before? \nPatient: Yeah, you have done it before, and it went away. \nDoctor: If we've done it before, we can do it again. \nPatient: Cool, can we do blood work, too? I want to check on my prostate. \nDoctor: Well, that's called P S A. \nPatient: Can I have that done? I'm concerned. I am fifty after all. \nDoctor: Sure, we can check your cholesterol too. I know you have history of it being high. \nPatient: You know, I've been working on that. I quit smoking for a while, but I got back into it. \nDoctor: That's good, it's really hard to quit. \nPatient: Yeah, I tried chewing tobacco, but it's not the same. \nDoctor: Be sure to keep trying to quit smoking."}
