For example:

Conversation:

Doctor: Is this baby number two? 
Patient: Yes, this is baby number two. 
Doctor: How many times have you been pregnant, including miscarriages or abortions if any? 
Patient: I've been pregnant two times in total. No miscarriages or abortions. 
Doctor: When was your last period? 
Patient: About a month ago. 
Doctor: And how would you describe your periods? Light, normal, heavy? 
Patient: Pretty normal. 
Doctor: Any abnormal pap smears? 
Patient: No, fortunately they've all been normal. 
Doctor: That's wonderful to hear. And my last question for you is if you've ever gotten a mammogram? 
Patient: I haven't gotten one before. Do I need to get one? I just turned thirty nine. What's the recommended age again? 
Doctor: It depends. For example, the recommended age would be younger for someone who has a family history of breast cancer. Given that you don't have a positive family history of breast cancer, I'd advise getting one in a few years at the age of forty five.
