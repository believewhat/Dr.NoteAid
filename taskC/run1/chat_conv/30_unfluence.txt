Doctor: How has your overall experience been with these medications?
Patient: Mostly positive. They help manage my conditions, and side effects are minimal.

Patient: They're less frequent and the consistency is different.
Doctor: Any fever or chills with the abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting?
Patient: No fever or chills, just nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
Doctor: How about headaches or sensitivity to light?

Doctor: I think you may have acute gastritis. We'll run tests and start treatment. How have you managed your diabetes and asthma symptoms?
Patient: I've been taking my medication and checking my blood sugar levels, but they're still high. I've been using my inhaler regularly for asthma.
Doctor: We'll adjust your diabetes and asthma medication, and continue treating your gastritis. I'll schedule a follow-up in 4 weeks.
