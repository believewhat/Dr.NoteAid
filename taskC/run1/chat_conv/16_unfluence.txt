Doctor: Hi there! How are you feeling today? I see that you're currently managing your rheumatoid arthritis. Can you tell me what medications you're taking for it?
Patient: I'm taking Xeljanz XR 11 mg and Celebrex 200 mg every day.
Doctor: I'm glad to hear you're on a treatment plan. Have these medications been helping with your rheumatoid arthritis symptoms?
Patient: They've been really helpful. My joints don't hurt as much and I can move around more easily.
Doctor: That's great news. Now, you mentioned your right knee has been bothering you. Can you describe the pain?
Patient: Yes. The pain level is at around 6 out of 10.
Doctor: What about any swelling you're experiencing?
Patient: My right knee is swollen.
Doctor: During the exam today, we found that there's still ongoing inflammation in your right knee. We performed a fluid aspiration and gave you a steroid injection. Do you know what fluid aspiration is?
Patient: I've heard of it, but I'm not exactly sure what it involves.
Doctor: Fluid aspiration involves removing excess fluid from your knee joint using a needle and syringe. This can help relieve pressure and reduce inflammation. Are you familiar with steroid injections?
Patient: Not exactly, can you explain?
Doctor: The steroid injection helps to further reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. We'll also arrange for an x-ray and refer you to physical therapy for additional support. How does that sound?
Patient: That sounds like a good plan.
Doctor: Great. Now, let's discuss the edema in your lower extremities. Have you tried wearing compression stockings?
Patient: I usually wear support hose, but it hasn't helped much.
Doctor: Have you tried elevating your feet?
Patient: I haven't seen my PCP yet.
Doctor: I recommend trying compression stockings, elevating your feet, and following a low salt diet to help manage the edema. But it's important to check with your PCP for further instructions and guidance.
Patient: I'll do that. Thanks for the advice.
Doctor: You're welcome. I also want to mention that Xeljanz is considered a high-risk medication. We'll need to monitor your CMP levels periodically every couple of months. Are you aware of this?
Patient: Yes, I understand the need for monitoring.
Doctor: Good. Before we end our session, I want to ensure you're aware of the risks and benefits associated with the fluid aspiration and steroid injection we performed today. Have you fully considered these risks before consenting to the procedure?
Patient: Yes, I understand the risks and I'm willing to proceed with the treatment plan.
Doctor: Great. Thank you for coming in today, and we'll see you at your next appointment. If you have any concerns or questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out.
