Doctor: Hey there, how are you feeling today? I see that you've been experiencing pain in your right elbow. Can you describe the type of pain you've been feeling?
Patient: It hurts when I move my arm or try to lift things. Feels like a sharp pain sometimes and other times it's more of a dull ache.
Doctor: Okay, based on your symptoms, it sounds like you may be experiencing medial epicondylitis (also known as golfer's elbow). I'll recommend some treatments such as rest, ice, and physical therapy. Does that sound good to you?
Patient: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you for your help. What is your current blood pressure reading and how has it been trending recently? I know you mentioned that you've been diagnosed with diabetes type 2 as well.
Doctor: Well, my blood pressure has been high for a while now, but I'm not sure what the exact number is. It's been fluctuating a lot. The doctor put me on Lisinopril 10 mg for it, and I haven't had any issues with my Metformin 500 mg twice daily for my diabetes. Have you been experiencing any symptoms related to your blood pressure, such as headaches or dizziness?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes I get headaches when my blood pressure spikes.
Doctor: Understood. We'll make sure to monitor your blood pressure more closely moving forward and adjust your medication if necessary. And back to your elbow pain, let's schedule some physical therapy sessions to help alleviate your symptoms. I see that you've been experiencing some pain in your right forearm and wrist lately. When did you first start experiencing the pain in your right forearm and wrist?
Patient: I think it started a few days ago. It just came out of nowhere.
Doctor: Alright. Let me take a look here. Can you tell me if you've experienced any recent trauma or injury to your right forearm and wrist?
Patient: Actually, now that you mention it, no. I haven't had any recent injuries or accidents. 
Doctor: Okay. Let me check your cardiovascular system real quick. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Pulses are equal bilaterally. Now let's move on to your respiratory system. Normal respiratory effort, no respiratory distress. Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation. Moving on to your skin, I don't see any rash or lesions. Finally, with regards to your musculoskeletal system, I can see moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. You also seem to be experiencing pain with resisted pronation of the right forearm as well as with flexion and bending of the right wrist. However, I don't see any bruising, swelling or discoloration or lesions.
Patient: Thank you for checking. So what could be causing this pain in my right forearm and wrist?
Doctor: Based on what I'm seeing, it seems like you might be experiencing some inflammation in your tendons or muscles. This could be due to overuse or repetitive movements. I'll recommend some rest and ice, as well as physical therapy exercises to help alleviate your symptoms. If the pain persists, we can run some further tests to see if there's any underlying damage or injury. And by the way, I noticed on your latest EKG that you have sinus tachycardia. Have you been experiencing any symptoms related to that, such as chest pain, fatigue, or shortness of breath?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any other symptoms besides the faster heart rate.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you made any changes to your daily routine, diet, or stress levels that may contribute to the sinus tachycardia?
Patient: Well, I've been eating healthier and managing my stress better, but I don't think those changes would cause this.
Doctor: I see. Do you drink caffeine or smoke? And do you notice any connection between their use and your faster heart rate?
Patient: I have coffee in the morning, but I haven't noticed it impacting my heart rate. I don't smoke or use nicotine products.
Doctor: Got it. Let's keep an eye on your heart rate and continue monitoring your blood pressure and diabetes as well. We'll work together to come up with a treatment plan that works best for you. How have you been doing with the conservative treatment we recommended for your medial epicondylitis?
Patient: It's been okay. I wear the sling and ice my elbow twice a day like you told me to, and I've been taking ibuprofen as well.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you noticed any improvements in your pain or range of motion since starting the treatment?
Patient: Yeah, the pain is not as bad as before and I can move my arm a little more easily now.
Doctor: Are you experiencing any side effects from the ibuprofen or other medications you are taking?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed anything so far.
Doctor: Have you scheduled your appointments with the physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy at Siskin Rehab Hospital yet?
Patient: No, not yet. You said the patient coordinator would give me a call within two days to set it up.
Doctor: Okay, make sure to schedule those appointments as soon as possible. Also, we're referring you for diabetic counseling and increasing your metformin dosage. How do you feel about that?
Patient: Alright, I'll do whatever it takes to manage my diabetes.
Doctor: Good attitude! We'll follow up with you in two weeks to review your hemoglobin A1c test and progress. Keep up with the prescribed treatment plan until then.
Patient: Will do, thanks for all your help.
