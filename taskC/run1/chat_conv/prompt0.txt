Doctor: Hi, Ms. Garcia! How are you feeling today?
Patient: Hello, doctor! I'm here for a follow-up on my chronic issues.
Doctor: What specific issues are we discussing?
Patient: My osteoarthritis in my elbows.
Doctor: How has it been affecting you recently?
Patient: It's been flaring up, especially in my right elbow. I think it might be because I've been sitting at the computer more in the office.
Doctor: Do you have a history of other conditions?
Patient: Yes, gout and psoriasis.
Doctor: How long since your last gout episode?
Patient: About three months ago.
Doctor: And your psoriasis?
Patient: It's under control.
Doctor: Are you taking medication for your gout?
Patient: Yes, colchicine 0.6 mg twice a day as needed.
Doctor: Let's discuss the numbness and tingling in your hands. How often does it happen?
Patient: Not all the time, just once in a while.
Doctor: Can you describe the intensity?
Patient: My hands feel tingly and numb, but it's not severe.
Doctor: What worsens the pain in your right elbow?
Patient: Lifting or carrying heavy things and sitting at the computer typing all day.
Doctor: Does it hurt when you're not doing anything?
Patient: Yes, sometimes it hurts even then.
Doctor: Have you tried treatments for your osteoarthritis?
Patient: Not yet. Any recommendations?
Doctor: We can discuss pain relievers or physical therapy next time.
Doctor: How long has this flare-up been going on?
Patient: A few weeks now.
Doctor: Any swelling or redness?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any.
Doctor: Have you experienced similar flare-ups before?
Patient: Yes, but with gout in my feet.
Doctor: Rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10.
Patient: It's around a 7.
Doctor: Have you noticed any weakness in your arm or hand?
Patient: Yes, opening jars is difficult and my grip strength feels weaker.
Doctor: Based on your exam, there is some edema and inflammation in your right elbow. We will order a right elbow x-ray and prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once a day for pain and swelling. Continue taking colchicine for gout and steroid cream for your psoriasis. Let's review your symptoms and treatment plan during your next visit.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
