Doctor: Hey there, nice to see you. You mentioned a knee injury and discomfort in your hands and wrists. Let's start with your knee. Can you tell me more about what happened?
Patient: I twisted my right knee playing basketball two weeks ago. It's been painful and swollen since then.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. How did your knee get injured exactly?
Patient: I felt a pop in my knee while playing, and it swelled up, making it hard to walk.
Doctor: Has the swelling improved since then?
Patient: It's better, but my knee is still not quite functional, and the pain is around 6-7 out of 10.
Doctor: Thanks for letting me know. Now, tell me about the discomfort in your hands and wrists.
Patient: I've been experiencing pain and stiffness from working at my desk job.
Doctor: It sounds like carpal tunnel syndrome. We can discuss treatment options later. Have you had difficulty moving your leg or noticed bruising?
Patient: Yes, I have difficulty with passive range of motion, and there's slight bruising around the joint.
Doctor: Did you experience discomfort during the palpation at the medial joint line?
Patient: Yes, it was quite painful when you pressed on that area.
Doctor: I recommend an MRI to assess your knee joint and seeing an orthopedist. What do you think?
Patient: That sounds like a good plan. Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: Let's discuss your hands and wrists. Have you noticed any changes in your health since your last visit?
Patient: No, everything has been the same.
Doctor: Lastly, you've been experiencing a red, bumpy rash. Can you describe it and where it's located?
Patient: It's a red and bumpy rash on my arms and legs.
Doctor: We'll take a closer look during the examination and discuss potential causes and treatments.
Doctor: Have you tried any treatments or remedies for the rash so far?
Patient: I've been using hydrocortisone cream, but it doesn't seem to help much.
Doctor: To determine the cause, we may need a skin biopsy or patch test. How does that sound?
Patient: That sounds fine. I just want to find out what's causing the rash and get relief.
Doctor: We'll schedule the necessary tests and find the most effective treatment. In the meantime, avoid scratching the affected areas.
Patient: I'll do my best. Thanks for your help, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. I'll see you at your next appointment. Take care.
