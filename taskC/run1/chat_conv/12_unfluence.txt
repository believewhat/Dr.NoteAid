Doctor: Hi there, Brittany. How have you been feeling recently?
Patient: I've been having cramps and sharp pains in my belly a few times a day. Sometimes it feels like someone is twisting my insides, and it hurts a lot. Sometimes I feel really bloated too.
Doctor: Can you describe the location of the pain in your abdomen?
Patient: It's mostly in the lower part of my belly.
Doctor: How often do these cramps and sharp pains occur, and how long do they last?
Patient: They happen a few times a day and usually last for a few minutes, but sometimes it can be longer.
Doctor: Have you noticed any patterns or triggers for these cramps and sharp pains, such as after eating certain foods or during a specific time of day?
Patient: No, I haven't really noticed any patterns or triggers. It just seems to happen randomly throughout the day.
Doctor: How has your IBS been since we last talked? Any changes in your bowel movements?
Patient: My stomach still hurts sometimes and I still need to go to the bathroom a lot. But it's not as bad as before.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms like less pain or fewer bowel movements?
Patient: A little bit, but it's still bothering me.
Doctor: How about your sleep? Any difficulty falling or staying asleep?
Patient: Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep, but once I'm out, it's okay. My sleep patterns haven't changed though.
Doctor: And how are your joints feeling? Any stiffness or pain since we talked about your arthritis?
Patient: Yeah, my joints hurt sometimes, especially after standing or walking for a while. And my hands are still stiff in the morning.
Doctor: Have you experienced any other symptoms besides the cramps and sharp pains, such as nausea or changes in bowel habits?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes I feel really nauseous and my stomach feels upset. And sometimes I have diarrhea or constipation too.
Doctor: What medications or supplements are you currently taking for your symptoms?
Patient: I've been taking Bentyl for intestinal cramping, Zofran for nausea, Citrucel for fiber, and probiotics to help with gas and bloating.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms since starting those medications and supplements?
Patient: They do help sometimes, but I still have flare-ups of my symptoms.
Doctor: Are there any particular foods or drinks that seem to make your symptoms worse?
Patient: Shrimp caused upper and lower abdominal pain and bloating, and I also have diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and drinking alcohol.
Doctor: How often do you drink alcohol and what types of drinks do you consume?
Patient: I usually have two drinks when I'm out, either tequila or brown liquor, and occasionally a martini.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or bowel movements lately?
Patient: My appetite has been pretty low and my bowel movements have been more frequent than usual.
Doctor: Have you traveled anywhere or tried any new foods or medications recently?
Patient: No, nothing like that. But one of my coworkers was sick last week and I was around them a lot.
Doctor: Let's take a closer look at your symptoms and run some tests to determine the cause. Have you talked to your doctor about taking medication for irritable bowel syndrome?
Patient: No, I haven't brought it up yet.
Doctor: I suggest discussing this option with your primary care physician or gastroenterologist. Remember, we talked about starting Elavil for your IBS, and you can take Bentyl before eating out at a restaurant. Also, use Zofran as needed for nausea, but try to reduce your intake of greasy, fatty foods and alcohol.
Patient: I'll definitely discuss this with my doctor and try to make the necessary changes to my diet and lifestyle.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Please keep me updated on your progress and any changes in your symptoms.
Patient: Will do. Thank you for all the guidance and advice.
Doctor: You're welcome. I'd like you to send me a MyChart message in about a month's time to let me know if you've experienced any side effects or issues with Elavil. Also, please let me know if you need any dose adjustments. If you have any concerns before then, don't hesitate to come back in for another appointment sooner.
Patient: Okay, that sounds good. I'll make sure to keep you updated and reach out if I need anything.
Doctor: Excellent. Remember, managing your symptoms is a collaborative effort, and I'm here to help you along the way. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.
Patient: I really appreciate that. Thank you for your help and for checking in on me.
Doctor: You're welcome, Brittany. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress. See you soon!
