Doctor: Hi, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hey. So, I came in for STD testing.
Doctor: Okay, got it. Have you been having unprotected sex with any new partners lately?
Patient: Yeah, my partner has been seeing other people, so I want to make sure everything is okay.
Doctor: I see. We'll need to run some tests to confirm if there are any infections. Also, have you noticed any changes in your vaginal discharge or odor?
Patient: Actually, yeah. The right side of my vagina hurts, and there are some differences in the discharge and smell.
Doctor: Alright, that's important information. It's possible that you may have contracted an STD or STI, so we'll do some testing to confirm. Besides the discomfort in your vaginal region, have you experienced any physical symptoms?
Patient: No fever or chills, but I've had headaches and confusion at times.
Doctor: Thanks for informing me. These symptoms could be related or unrelated to a potential infection, so we'll keep them in mind as we run our tests. In the meantime, practice safe sex to avoid transmitting anything. And let us know if you notice any abnormal changes in your mood or behavior.
Doctor: How was your pelvic exam?
Patient: They checked everything down there and said it all looked normal. No weird smells or anything. They took swabs to test for diseases though.
Doctor: Good to hear. During the exam, did you feel any pain or discomfort?
Patient: Nope, it didn't hurt at all.
Doctor: Great. According to the notes, there were no external lesions, and your labia majora and minora appeared normal. Your discharge was also typical in color and odor. Did they mention anything specific about your cervix or vaginal wall?
Patient: No, they said both were normal, and there was no cervical motion tenderness or masses noted.
Doctor: Perfect. They also obtained swabs for sexual transmitted disease testing. Have you received those results yet?
Patient: Not yet.
Doctor: Have you been sexually active recently?
Patient: Yes, I have.
Doctor: We'll screen for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C. You're considered high risk due to your previous abnormal Pap Smear and recent discovery of your partner's multiple sexual encounters.
Patient: Okay, got it.
Doctor: We'll call you with the laboratory testing results once we have them. Thank you for coming in today.
