Doctor: Hey there, nice to see you again. How are you feeling today?
Patient: My right ankle is hurting a lot and it's also swollen.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain in your right ankle?
Patient: The pain is really bad, like a 7 out of 10.
Doctor: How long has your ankle been hurting and swollen?
Patient: It's been hurting for a few days now and the swelling is making it worse.
Doctor: Did anything specific cause this pain?
Patient: I had a right ankle sprain while running a few weeks ago.
Doctor: I found swelling and tenderness in your ankle. Any changes in sensation or numbness?
Patient: No, my sensation feels normal. It just hurts when touched.
Doctor: Have you tried anything to alleviate the swelling and tenderness?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking over-the-counter pain meds and using ice.
Doctor: Continue using crutches for 1 to 2 days, then weight-bearing as tolerated. Take NSAIDs for pain as needed. You should see improvement in 2 weeks.
Patient: Okay, thank you doctor. I hope the pain gets better soon.
Doctor: We'll monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan if needed. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks.
Patient: Okay, sounds good. Thank you for letting me know.
Doctor: If there are any changes or worsening of symptoms before the next appointment, please call our office right away.
Patient: Will do, thank you.
