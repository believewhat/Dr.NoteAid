Doctor: Hi there, Brittany. How have you been feeling recently?
Patient: I've been having cramps and sharp pains in my belly a few times a day. Sometimes it feels like someone is twisting my insides, and it hurts a lot. Sometimes I feel really bloated too.
Doctor: Can you describe the location of the pain in your abdomen?
Patient: It's mostly in the lower part of my belly.
Doctor: How often do these cramps and sharp pains occur, and how long do they last?
Patient: They happen a few times a day and usually last for a few minutes, but sometimes it can be longer.
Doctor: Have you noticed any patterns or triggers for these cramps and sharp pains, such as after eating certain foods or during a specific time of day?
Patient: No, I haven't really noticed any patterns or triggers. It just seems to happen randomly throughout the day.
Doctor: How has your IBS been since we last talked? Any changes in your bowel movements?
Patient: My stomach still hurts sometimes and I still need to go to the bathroom a lot. But it's not as bad as before.

Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms like less pain or fewer bowel movements?
Patient: A little bit, but it's still bothering me.
Doctor: How about your sleep? Any difficulty falling or staying asleep?
Patient: Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep, but once I'm out, it's okay. My sleep patterns haven't changed though.
Doctor: And how are your joints feeling? Any stiffness or pain since we talked about your arthritis?
Patient: Yeah, my joints hurt sometimes, especially after standing or walking for a while. And my hands are still stiff in the morning.
Doctor: Have you experienced any other symptoms besides the cramps and sharp pains, such as nausea or changes in bowel habits?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes I feel really nauseous and my stomach feels upset. And sometimes I have diarrhea or constipation too.
Doctor: What medications or supplements are you currently taking for your symptoms?
Patient: I've been taking Bentyl for intestinal cramping, Zofran for nausea, Citrucel for fiber, and probiotics to help with gas and bloating.

Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms since starting those medications and supplements?
Patient: They do help sometimes, but I still have flare-ups of my symptoms.
Doctor: Are there any particular foods or drinks that seem to make your symptoms worse?
Patient: Shrimp caused upper and lower abdominal pain and bloating, and I also have diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and drinking alcohol.
Doctor: How often do you drink alcohol and what types of drinks do you consume?
Patient: I usually have two drinks when I'm out, either tequila or brown liquor, and occasionally a martini.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or bowel movements lately?
Patient: My appetite has been pretty low and my bowel movements have been more frequent than usual.

Doctor: Have you traveled anywhere or tried any new foods or medications recently?
Patient: No, nothing like that. But one of my coworkers was sick last week and I was around them a lot.
Doctor: Let's take a closer look at your symptoms and run some tests to determine the cause. Have you talked to your doctor about taking medication for irritable bowel syndrome?
Patient: No, I haven't brought it up yet.
Doctor: I suggest discussing this option with your primary care physician or gastroenterologist. Remember, we talked about starting Elavil for your IBS, and you can take Bentyl before eating out at a restaurant. Also, use Zofran as needed for nausea, but try to reduce your intake of greasy, fatty foods and alcohol.
