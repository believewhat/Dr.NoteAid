Doctor: Hey there, nice to see you again. How are you feeling today? Can you tell me more about the pain and swelling in your right ankle?
Patient: My right ankle is hurting a lot and it's also swollen.
Doctor: What is the level of pain you are experiencing in your right ankle?
Patient: The pain is really bad, like a 7 out of 10. It's been hurting for a few days now and the swelling is making it worse.
Doctor: Okay, let me take a look at your ankle. Did anything specific happen that may have caused this pain?
Patient: I had a right ankle sprain while running a few weeks ago. It hurt pretty bad at the time and has been bothering me ever since.
Doctor: During the examination, I found swelling over the lateral malleolus and tenderness to palpation anterolaterally in the soft tissue. However, there was no bony tenderness on palpation of the foot. Have you noticed any changes in sensation or numbness in your right ankle?
Patient: No, my sensation feels normal. It just hurts when touched.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. Have you tried anything to alleviate the swelling and tenderness in your right ankle?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking over-the-counter pain meds and using ice to try to manage the pain.
Doctor: That's good. Based on your symptoms and medical history, I would like you to continue using crutches for the next 1 to 2 days followed by weight-bearing as tolerated. Also, take NSAIDs for pain control as needed. You should see significant improvement in your symptoms over the next 2 weeks.
Patient: Okay, thank you doctor. Additionally, I hope the pain will get better soon. 
Doctor: Don't worry, we'll monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. So, we will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your progress and determine when you can return to play. If there are any changes or worsening of symptoms before the next appointment, please call our office right away.
Patient: Okay, sounds good. Thank you for letting me know.
