Doctor: Hi there! How are you feeling today?
Patient: Not so great, my lower back has been hurting a lot lately.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the pain? When did it start and what kind of pain is it?
Patient: It started about 2 weeks ago and it's an aching pain that sometimes feels sharp. It's been getting worse and it's now radiating down my left leg.
Doctor: I see. Have you tried any over-the-counter pain relievers for the pain?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol but they don't seem to be helping much.
Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your leg? And have you experienced any weakness or loss of sensation in your leg?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling, but my leg does feel weak sometimes.
Doctor: I understand. Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have a herniated disc in your lower back. Have you had any previous episodes of back pain in the past?
Patient: Yeah, I've had some occasional back pain before but this feels different.
Doctor: Got it. Have you experienced any difficulty with bowel or bladder function?
Patient: No, everything seems to be normal in that regard.
Doctor: That's good to hear. I also noticed from your medical history that you have a sedentary job where you sit most of the time. Do you take breaks and stretch throughout the day?
Patient: Not really, I try to exercise inconsistently though.
Doctor: I understand. It's important to take breaks and stretch throughout the day to avoid exacerbating the pain. Based on your physical exam and MRI results, it appears that you have a herniated disc in your lower back that's causing the pain and possibly affecting the nerves in your leg. We can explore treatment options such as physical therapy or medication to manage the pain and prevent any further damage. In the meantime, you can try using heat or ice therapy to alleviate the discomfort. Any questions so far?
Patient: No, not really. What are the treatment options?
Doctor: Well, we could try corticosteroid injections into your lower back to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. However, it's important to note that there are risks involved, such as bleeding, infection, nerve damage, and skin changes. If you're diabetic, there's also a risk of elevated glucose levels. We can discuss other options if you prefer.
Patient: I'll try the injection. What do I need to know before we get started?
Doctor: Great. I just want to make sure you're aware of the risks involved and that we'll be monitoring you carefully during and after the injection. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
Patient: No, let's do it.
