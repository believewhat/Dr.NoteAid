Doctor: Hey Amanda, how are you feeling today?
Patient: I've been feeling okay, thanks.
Doctor: I see that your BP is currently at 150/100, which is high. Are you taking any medications for it?
Patient: Yes, I've been prescribed hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril.
Doctor: How has the medication been working for you?
Patient: It's been helping, but my blood pressure is still higher than it should be.
Doctor: Have you experienced any side effects from the medications?
Patient: Yes, I've been experiencing side effects from lisinopril such as headaches, "swooshing" in my left ear, and lethargy.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's talk about lifestyle changes. Have you made any since your last visit?
Patient: No, but I do admit to consuming alcohol 4-5 times a week.
Doctor: How many drinks do you have each time?
Patient: I usually have about 2-3 drinks each time.
Doctor: It's important to monitor your alcohol consumption as it can affect your blood pressure. Have you considered Naltrexone injections for your alcohol use disorder?
Patient: Yes, I am interested in that.
Doctor: Great, we can discuss that further. Do you check your blood pressure at home?
Patient: No, I haven't checked my blood pressure at home.
Doctor: Have you noticed any significant changes in your readings lately?
Patient: It's been pretty stable, but still higher than it should be. Sometimes I get headaches and feel dizzy.
Doctor: Is there anything that triggers these symptoms or makes them worse?
Patient: Well, I used to drink a lot of alcohol. But I've cut back recently.
Doctor: How much were you drinking before, and how frequently?
Patient: I used to drink every day, sometimes more than one drink. But now I only drink occasionally.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvements in your symptoms since cutting back on alcohol?
Patient: Yes, I feel better overall. The headaches and dizziness aren't as frequent.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Now, let's discuss your deferred vaccinations. Have you experienced any symptoms of the flu or shingles since deferring your recommended vaccinations?
Patient: Nah, I haven't felt sick or anything like that. I just don't like getting shots, you know?
Doctor: Have you experienced any new or worsening symptoms such as headache, fatigue, muscle aches, or sore throat since deferring your vaccinations?
Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. Just been feeling like my usual self, you know?
Doctor: Alright, just keep in mind that upgrading your influenza vaccination and getting your Shingrix #2 dose can help prevent some serious illnesses. Let's work together to come up with a plan to reduce your alcohol consumption and manage your hypertension. Oh, and one more thing - how has naltrexone been going for you?
Patient: It's been going pretty well actually. The injectable form makes it easier to stick to.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Keep up the good work, and I'll see you soon. By the way, I see that you recently had some lab tests done. Were there any symptoms or concerns that prompted these lab tests?
Patient: No, I didn't have any symptoms or concerns. The tests were just part of my routine check-up.
Doctor: Well, I have good news for you. Your CMP and CBC results were essentially unremarkable. There's nothing to worry about. Let's continue to manage your hypertension through lifestyle changes and monitor your heart rate and blood pressure while you're on the medication.
