CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Ibuprofen.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Anxiety.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

Lumbar fusion

Examination of the back shows range of motion without pain. Straight leg raise is negative. Sensation is intact.

RESULTS

X-rays of the lumbar spine show no obvious signs of acute fracture. Evidence of a prior lumbar fusion with hardware in good position.

Lumbar spine strain.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended ice and heat. She will continue with Motrin 800 mg 3 times a day with food. She will follow up with me as needed.
","Doctor: Hey Ms. Lee, how are you feeling today? I wanted to ask you about the back pain you mentioned previously, but first can you tell me more about your lumbar fusion procedure?
Patient: Sure, it was a surgery to fix my lower back. They fused two of my vertebrae together to make my spine more stable. It was a few months ago, and I do feel like I can move around better now and do more things without experiencing as much pain.
Doctor: That's great to hear! Have you experienced any side effects or complications from the surgery, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs?
Patient: No, luckily I haven't had any of those. Overall, I feel like the surgery has helped me a lot and I'm glad I went through with it.
Doctor: Alright, that's good news. Now, back to your current issue - can you tell me more about your back pain? How did it start and where exactly is the pain located?
Patient: Well, I was at a birthday party and I twisted my back while dancing. Since then, the pain has been pretty bad. The pain is mostly in the middle of my back, and it's around a 6 or 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.
Doctor: Ouch, that sounds painful. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain worse or better?
Patient: Lying flat seems to make it worse, and twisting motions definitely hurt. I haven't found anything that really helps yet.
Doctor: Thank you for letting me know. Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have strained a muscle or ligament in your back. Are you currently taking any medication for the pain?
Patient: Just ibuprofen.
Doctor: Okay, I'm going to recommend Motrin 800 mg three times a day with food, which should help relieve the pain. In addition to medication, I'd also suggest using ice and heat therapy to manage the pain. 
Patient: Okay, I'll try that.
Doctor: Great. Before we finish, I noticed in your medical history that you've struggled with anxiety. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yeah, I feel really nervous and worried all the time. Sometimes my heart races and I have trouble sleeping because I can't stop thinking about things. It happens a lot, like almost every night. And during the day too, especially when I have to do something that makes me nervous or scared. I've tried deep breathing exercises and meditation, but they don't always work.
Doctor: I understand. There are other options we can explore to help manage your anxiety, such as therapy or medication. Would you be open to discussing these options further?
Patient: Yes, I would be willing to try whatever might help. Thank you, doctor."

Doctor: Can you describe the location and severity of your knee pain, as well as any factors that exacerbate or alleviate it?
Patient: It's a pretty severe pain on the side of my right knee that gets worse when I walk or exercise. Rest helps alleviate it a little.
Doctor: We diagnosed you with chondromalacia of the right patella. I'm prescribing ibuprofen 600 mg four times a day with food and some exercises to strengthen your quadriceps. I recommend swimming freestyle laps as an activity that is less straining on your joints.
Patient: Okay, thank you. How long should I continue this treatment?
Doctor: If your pain doesn't improve in a couple of weeks, please follow up with us.
Patient: Will do. Thank you for your help.
Doctor: You're welcome. We also noticed chronic back pain on your record. Is it still under control?
Patient: Yes, it's stable at the moment.
Doctor: Great. And how about your carpal tunnel syndrome?
Patient: I had a release surgery before and it's relatively stable now.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Please continue your current regimen for both conditions. If anything changes, let us know.
Patient: Got it. Thank you again.
Doctor: No problem. We'll see you next time."

Patient: It's been well-controlled, thanks to the dietary modifications I've made to limit my sodium intake.
Doctor: That's excellent news. Regarding your diabetes type 2, have you been having any issues with nausea due to the medication or diet restrictions?
Patient: Yes, I've had some nausea because of the Lyme disease, but I've been compliant with the use of metformin and following the recommended diet.
Doctor: Okay. Lastly, let me prescribe something to help with your sore throat and hoarseness. Please keep taking your medications as prescribed and make sure to follow up with us if you have any concerns or questions. By the way, how are you currently managing your diabetes and hypertension?

Doctor: No worries, can you describe the blue pill you take in the morning for your heart? How often do you take it and do you experience any side effects?
Patient: Sure thing. I take one small blue pill every morning and haven't noticed any side effects from it. It seems to help my heart beat better or something like that. As for my joint pain and acid reflux, I can't recall the names of the medications right now.
Doctor: Okay, we can check your records later. I also noticed that you mentioned having trouble sleeping at night. How long has this been going on and have you tried anything to alleviate it?
Patient: It's been happening for a while now. I've tried drinking chamomile tea before bed and avoiding screens for an hour before sleeping but nothing seems to work.

Doctor: I haven't noticed any heart palpitations or shortness of breath. Should I be concerned?
Doctor: We'll need to do some further testing to determine the cause of the irregularities. Finally, I noticed that your abdomen was soft and there was no edema in your lower extremities. That's great news! So, what should I do next?
Patient: We'll schedule some additional tests to evaluate your thyroid function and cardiovascular health. In the meantime, it's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle by exercising regularly and eating a balanced diet.

Doctor: Hi there! I noticed that your glucose and HbA1c levels are elevated. Have you been experiencing any symptoms related to high blood sugar such as increased thirst or frequent urination?
Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really thirsty lately and have to pee a lot more than usual.
Doctor: Okay, I'm going to order a complete metabolic panel for further evaluation. We'll check your other blood levels too to see if anything else is going on. And it looks like we've started you on metformin for diabetes. How has that been affecting your blood sugar levels and overall symptoms? Have you experienced any side effects such as nausea or diarrhea?
Patient: Metformin has helped my blood sugar levels stay more stable and my symptoms of increased urination, thirst, and dry mouth have improved. But I have experienced some stomach problems like diarrhea and feeling sick to my stomach since starting the medicine.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you noticed any changes in your diet or exercise habits since starting metformin?
Patient: Not really, no. I try to eat healthier and get some exercise when I can, but it's been difficult lately.
Doctor: Understandable. Well, it sounds like the metformin is helping to manage your symptoms. Keep monitoring your blood sugar levels and let me know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Finally, let's make sure we follow up on the tests we discussed earlier and keep track of any changes in your condition. Also, what dietary modifications have you made or are willing to make to manage your glucose levels?
Patient: I've been trying to eat more vegetables and less sugar. I also started drinking more water instead of soda.
Doctor: That's a good start! Let me provide you with a glucometer so that you can monitor your glucose levels at home. Also, I will refill your metoprolol prescription. Are you comfortable with this medical treatment plan?

Follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female presenting today for an annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.

Mrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.

She hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.

Over the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.

She notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.

Mrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.

She has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.

The patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Asthma.
Allergy rhinitis.
Food allergies to peanut and tree nuts.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Currently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Wixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.
Proair HFA as needed.
EpiPen as needed.
Alvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.

ALLERGIES

Peanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.
Montelukast sodium, -eizure-like-reaction.

RESULTS

Asthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.
Current food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.

ASSESSMENT

-Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.
-Allergic rhinitis.
-Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

PLAN

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
The patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.

Allergic rhinitis
She will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
The patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.

INSTRUCTIONS

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
Start Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.

Allergic rhinitis
Continue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
Continue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today.","Doctor: Hi there! How have your asthma and allergies been since our last appointment?
Patient: I've been struggling with them recently. My asthma has been causing me to have more attacks, and my allergies have been bothering me almost every day.
Doctor: That's not good to hear. Have you been taking your inhaler as prescribed and avoiding triggers for your allergies?
Patient: I try to take my inhaler as prescribed, but sometimes I forget. And for my allergies, I make sure to avoid peanuts and tree nuts as much as possible.
Doctor: Okay, we need to work on being consistent with your medication and continuing to avoid triggers. Have you noticed any other triggers besides peanuts that cause a reaction?
Patient: No, they seem to happen randomly. But peanuts always cause a reaction for me.
Doctor: That's concerning. Have you ever been prescribed Montelukast sodium for your allergies?
Patient: Yes, I have. But I had a ""seizure-like"" reaction to it and had to stop taking it.
Doctor: Have you ever been hospitalized for your peanut allergy before?
Patient: Yes, I've been to the hospital a few times because of my peanut allergy. It's really scary when it happens.
Doctor: Do you always carry an epinephrine auto-injector with you in case of a severe reaction?
Patient: Yes, I always carry an epinephrine auto-injector with me in case of a severe reaction to peanuts. My doctor told me to.
Doctor: Let's make sure you're carrying it with you at all times. On another note, I see you have a rash on your arm. Is there anything different that might have caused it?
Patient: No, nothing out of the ordinary. I haven't changed my routine or used any new products.
Doctor: Based on what you've told me, I don't see any significant findings for the rash. However, let's focus on managing your asthma and allergies. Speaking of which, how have you been feeling lately? Have you experienced any breathing difficulties or chest tightness?
Patient: Yeah, I still feel a bit of difficulty breathing sometimes, but it's not as bad as before.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you been taking your medications as prescribed, including the Wixela Inhub and Alvesco?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking them every day like you told me to.
Doctor: Great. Have you noticed any triggers or patterns that seem to worsen your breathing difficulties?
Patient: It seems to get worse when I'm doing intense exercise or around smoke or strong smells.
Doctor: Okay, we can try to avoid those triggers as much as possible. Keep up with taking your medications as prescribed and avoiding any triggers that worsen your symptoms. Let me know if anything changes or if you have any concerns. So I see from your medical history that you have moderate persistent asthma. Have you noticed any triggers for your asthma symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, whenever I'm around smoke or dust, my breathing gets really bad. It's hard for me to catch my breath.
Doctor: That's understandable. Have you been avoiding smoke and dust as much as possible to help manage your asthma symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I try to stay away from them as much as I can. But sometimes it's hard, especially when I'm outside or around other people who smoke.
Doctor: I understand. Have you tried using a rescue inhaler during these episodes of breathing difficulty?
Patient: Yeah, I have. It helps a little bit, but I still feel like I'm struggling to breathe.
Doctor: Okay, well another option we could consider is using a daily maintenance inhaler to help prevent asthma symptoms from occurring in the first place. What do you think about that?
Patient: No, I haven't thought about that. What does it do?
Doctor: It helps to reduce inflammation in your airways over time, which can make your asthma symptoms less severe and frequent. Given your history of moderate persistent asthma, it may be worth considering. Also, I see that you had an anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts at some point. Have you been avoiding peanuts since then?
Patient: Yes, I have. I've been really careful to read food labels and avoid anything with peanuts in it.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Do you also experience allergic rhinitis, or nasal allergies?
Patient: Yes, I do. My nose gets really stuffy and runny, especially in the spring and fall.
Doctor: Okay, we'll definitely want to keep an eye on that as well. In the meantime, let's talk more about the possibility of starting a maintenance inhaler for your asthma. Additionally, I understand you have aspirations to join the military. Can you tell me more about that and how your asthma may affect that goal?
Patient: Yeah, I really want to join the military but I heard they have physical fitness requirements that I need to meet without using my inhaler. So that's been on my mind.
Doctor: I understand. Have you discussed your aspirations to join the military with your primary care physician? It may be a good idea to schedule an appointment with them to discuss this further and undergo pulmonary function tests to assess your lung function. This can help determine whether alternative treatment options or accommodations may be necessary to help you achieve your goals while still managing your asthma effectively.
Patient: No, I haven't talked to my doctor about it yet. But I'll definitely do that. Thanks for the advice, doc. And thank you for checking out my rash too."

High blood pressure and palpitations.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jordan Roberts is a 49-year-old with a long history of hypertension and an acute episode of palpitations.

In March, Mr. Roberts went to the emergency room for palpitations and hypertension. He attributed this to a panic attack, but also stated he consumed several cups of coffee on an empty stomach the morning of. He denies additional episodes of palpitations.

He has been monitoring his blood pressure at home daily, obtaining systolic blood pressure readings of 146 to 155. He does report a family history of hypertension. Additionally, he has been monitoring his salt intake and feels he is doing well at reducing it. He also walks on his treadmill as often as he can.

He has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication Benicar HCT, which he has been using for the past month.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypertension.

FAMILY HISTORY

Several family members positive for hypertension.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benicar HCT 40 mg/25 mg
Amlodipine 10 mg daily.

Physical Examination

Cardiovascular
Normal rate, regular rhythm, S2 normal, normal heart sounds, and normal pulses.

Pulmonary/Chest
Breath sounds normal. 

Abdominal
There is no tenderness.

Musculoskeletal
There is no edema.

RESULTS

Thyroid profile 03/01/2021.

ASSESSMENT

-Resistant hypertension.

Mr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension, with systolic blood pressure readings between 146-155. He is currently on maximal doses for 3 medications.

PLAN

I have added spironolactone to his regimen which will require monitoring of his potassium and sodium. We will schedule him for a follow up in 2 weeks to complete a basic metabolic panel and check his blood pressure. Next medication to consider adding is carvedilol. I have tried to avoid this, given the potential for issues with erectile dysfunction. I counseled the patient about spironolactone side effects, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, as well as his increased risk of dehydration, with one sign to watch for being dizziness. If we are not able to improve his blood pressure with spironolactone, the next step would be sending him to the resistant hypertension clinic.

I provided and reviewed with Mr. Roberts the American Heart association website (heart.org) and encouraged him to access for tips on lowering his salt intake and increasing his potassium intake. His maximum salt intake should be 1500 to <2000 mg per day. He was provided materials to follow the DASH diet and encouraged to meet 30-min of walking most days.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment in 2 weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel. Reduce sodium intake to 1500 to <2000 mg per day. Follow DASH diet.
","Doctor: Hi there, good to see you again. Last time we spoke, we discussed your hypertension and it seems like your blood pressure is still consistently high. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that may be causing it?
Patient: Yeah, I've noticed it goes up when I'm stressed or anxious.
Doctor: That's understandable. Have you made any changes to your diet or exercise routine to help lower your blood pressure?
Patient: I've been trying to eat healthier and incorporate more fruits and vegetables into my meals, but it hasn't made much of a difference.
Doctor: Given your history of obesity and tobacco use, have you considered working with a nutritionist or quitting smoking to help lower your blood pressure?
Patient: Yeah, I know I need to make some changes. I've been thinking about quitting smoking and getting help with my diet.
Doctor: Great, let's work together to come up with a plan that works for you. In the meantime, let's monitor your blood pressure and consider adjusting your medication dosage if necessary. Speaking of medications, have you experienced any side effects since starting them?
Patient: No, I haven't had any issues.
Doctor: That's good to hear. On another note, during our last appointment, you mentioned fast heartbeats and palpitations. I'd like to perform an EKG to rule out any potential issues. Would that be okay with you?
Patient: Yeah, that sounds good.
Doctor: Excellent, let's schedule that for you. And before we end this visit, I wanted to let you know that I added spironolactone to your medication regimen. It's important to monitor your potassium and sodium levels while taking it. We'll schedule a follow-up in two weeks for a basic metabolic panel and blood pressure check.
Patient: Okay, I'll keep that in mind.
Doctor: The next medication we may consider adding is carvedilol. But before we do that, I need to talk to you about potential side effects of spironolactone such as gynecomastia, electrolyte disturbances, and dehydration. One sign to watch out for is dizziness. Have you experienced any of these symptoms since starting spironolactone?
Patient: No, I feel pretty normal.
Doctor: Great. Remember, if we're not able to improve your blood pressure with spironolactone, we may have to send you to the resistant hypertension clinic. But for now, let's monitor your progress and make sure you don't experience any negative side effects from your medication. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up or if you have any questions.
Patient: Alright, thank you so much for your help.
Doctor: Of course, take care and stay healthy."

Follow up irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Brittany Edwards is a pleasant 32-year-old female who returns in follow up for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with functional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Ms. Edwards was last seen in August 2019 with flares of abdominal pain and was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome that was treated with Bentyl. She had a previous prescription for Reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea. She was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement such as Citrucel daily, probiotics to help with gas and bloating, and Bentyl up to 4 times daily for intestinal cramping. She was instructed to discontinue Reglan and to use Zofran as needed for nausea. Neuromodulators such as Elavil and Buspar were discussed but not started.

Ms. Edwards continues to have intermittent abdominal symptoms. Monday through Thursday she has less flare ups of her symptoms but states she is currently having cramps and sharp pains. She describes she recently ate shrimp which caused her to have both upper and lower abdominal pain and bloating. However, she notices episodes of diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and consuming alcohol. She does not believe the alfredo contributes to her symptoms. The patient states she consumes 2 drinks when out of either tequila or brown liquor and occasionally a martini. She does her best to avoid -eavy foods,-but ate fried chicken today without any symptoms. She has stopped drinking sodas which has been helpful.-he patient reports passing 2-3 formed stools a day.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS

PHYSICAL EXAM

Alert and cooperative, appears stated age.

Respiratory
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
Heart regular rate and rhythm.

Gastrointestinal
Abdomen soft, non-tender, no masses or organomegaly. Normoactive bowel sounds.

ASSESSMENT

-Irritable bowel syndrome

Brittany Edwards is a 32-year-old established patient who returned today to discuss management of IBS and functional abdominal pain made worse by high stress, poor eating habits, and poor sleeping habits.

PLAN

I have encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications as well as starting a neuromodulator, such as Elavil 25 mg at bedtime for IBS. She can use-entyl-0 mg as needed 30-45 minutes-efore eating out at a restaurant. She can also use Zofran as needed for nausea. However, I have encouraged her to reduce greasy fatty foods and alcohol consumption.

INSTRUCTIONS

Send MyChart message in 1 month regarding any side effects of issues with Elavil or if dose adjustments are needed.
Return to clinic in 1 month or sooner if needed.","Doctor: Hi there, Brittany. How have you been feeling recently?
Patient: I've been having cramps and sharp pains in my belly a few times a day. Sometimes it feels like someone is twisting my insides, and it hurts a lot. Sometimes I feel really bloated too.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about the location, frequency, and duration of these cramps and sharp pains in your abdomen?
Patient: It's mostly in the lower part of my belly and it happens a few times a day. The pain usually lasts for a few minutes, but sometimes it can be longer.
Doctor: Have you noticed any patterns or triggers for these cramps and sharp pains, such as after eating certain foods or during a specific time of day?
Patient: No, I haven't really noticed any patterns or triggers. It just seems to happen randomly throughout the day.
Doctor: And how's your IBS been since we last talked? Any discomfort or changes in your bowel movements?
Patient: Yeah, my stomach still hurts sometimes and I still need to go to the bathroom a lot. But it's not as bad as before.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms like less pain or fewer bowel movements?
Patient: A little bit, but it's still bothering me.
Doctor: Alright. How about your sleep? Any difficulty falling or staying asleep?
Patient: Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep, but once I'm out, it's okay. My sleep patterns haven't changed though.
Doctor: Got it. And how are your joints feeling? Any stiffness or pain since we talked about your arthritis?
Patient: Yeah, my joints hurt sometimes, especially after standing or walking for a while. And my hands are still stiff in the morning.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, have you experienced any other symptoms besides the cramps and sharp pains, such as nausea or changes in bowel habits?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes I feel really nauseous and my stomach feels upset. And sometimes I have diarrhea or constipation too.
Doctor: Have you been taking any medication or supplements for your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking Bentyl four times a day for intestinal cramping. I also used Reglan as needed for nausea, but you told me to stop taking that and use Zofran instead. I started taking Citrucel daily for fiber and probiotics to help with gas and bloating.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms since starting those medications and supplements?
Patient: They do help sometimes, but I still have flare-ups of my symptoms.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any particular foods or drinks that seem to make your symptoms worse?
Patient: Well, I recently ate shrimp which caused both upper and lower abdominal pain and bloating. But I also notice episodes of diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and drinking alcohol.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. How often do you drink alcohol and what types of drinks do you consume?
Patient: I usually have two drinks when I'm out, either tequila or brown liquor, and occasionally a martini. I try to avoid heavy foods, but I ate fried chicken today without any symptoms.
Doctor: Alright, thank you for all that information. We'll work together to find the best treatment plan for you. 
Also, I heard you mentioned experiencing nausea and stomach pain. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or bowel movements lately?
Patient: My appetite has been pretty low and my bowel movements have been more frequent than usual. It's been about a few days now.
Doctor: Have you traveled anywhere or tried any new foods or medications recently?
Patient: No, nothing like that. But one of my coworkers was sick last week and I was around them a lot.
Doctor: Alright, let's take a closer look at your symptoms and run some tests to determine the cause.
And based on our previous conversation, can you tell me if you've experienced any abnormalities or concerns with your respiratory, cardiovascular, urinary, or musculoskeletal systems?
Patient: No, everything seems fine in those areas.
Doctor: I suggest discussing taking medication for irritable bowel syndrome with your primary care physician or gastroenterologist. It could help alleviate your symptoms.
And just a reminder, we talked about starting Elavil 25 mg at bedtime for your IBS, and you can take Bentyl 20 mg 30-45 minutes before eating out at a restaurant. You can also use Zofran as needed for nausea, but try to reduce your intake of greasy, fatty foods and alcohol.
So, based on our discussion today, I'd like you to send me a message in about a month's time to let me know if you've experienced any side effects or issues with Elavil. Also, please let me know if you need any dose adjustments. If you have any concerns before then, don't hesitate to come back in for another appointment sooner.
Patient: Okay, sounds good. Thanks for checking in on me."

Follow up adult hydrocephalus, 3 months status post shunt surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow up of adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing shunt surgery 08/01/2020. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, together they give his history.

I have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020. He presented with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on 08/01/2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.

Mr. Watson has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter states that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder control, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Theresa and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Hannah summarized it best according to the two of them, she said - feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.-Mr. Watson has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen.

PAST HISTORY

Urinary incontinence.
Adult hydrocephalus.
Gait impairment.
Cognitive impairment.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

-Constitutional Symptoms: Significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions. Negative for fever or unintentional weight loss.
-Genitourinary: Significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper. Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output.
-Neurological: Significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment. Negative for headaches, recent falls, or hallucinations.
-Psychiatric: Negative for depression, excessive worrying, or mood swings.

VITALS

Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Mr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.

Head and Face
The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.

Neurological
Mental status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.
Gait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.
Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.
Motor: Normal for bulk and strength.
Coordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.

RESULTS

CT scan of the head from 10/15/2020: It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.

ASSESSMENT

-Adult hydrocephalus.
-Gait impairment.
-Urinary incontinence and urgency.
-Cognitive impairment.

Mr. Watson has made some improvement with his hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. There is a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.

Mr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.

PLAN

I had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 3 months.","
Doctor: Hey there, it's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since your shunt surgery for hydrocephalus? And how has Mr. Watson been doing since his shunt surgery in August 2020?
Patient: I've been feeling okay since the surgery, thanks for asking. My dad has been doing pretty well too. He's been feeling better and his headaches have gone down a bit.
Doctor: That's great progress for both of you. Have either of you noticed any changes in your symptoms or overall health since the shunt surgeries?
Patient: Well, I don't feel as much pressure in my head anymore and my headaches have decreased. But sometimes I still feel a little off. My dad hasn't had any major issues since his surgery, we're just glad that it seems to have helped him.
Doctor: Okay, that's good to hear. How is your recovery progressing following the shunt surgery? Have you experienced any issues with wound healing, pain management, or mobility?
Patient: My recovery is going pretty well. I'm able to move around just fine without any pain or complications. And my dad hasn't had any side effects since his surgery either.
Doctor: Great! Can you tell me more about the trouble you're having walking and cognitive impairment?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble walking and my mind feels a bit foggy. It's been going on for a while now. Sometimes I forget things easily and have trouble concentrating on tasks for too long.
Doctor: When did you first notice these symptoms, and have they progressed over time?
Patient: I can't remember exactly when it started, but it's getting worse over time. It's harder to walk without stumbling and my thinking is slowing down too. I've also been experiencing gait impairment and urinary incontinence and urgency.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms related to adult hydrocephalus, it seems that there may be some cognitive impairment as well. We will need to run some tests to get a better idea of what is going on. Also, I see that you had a CT scan of the head. Can you tell me more about the tiny amount of blood in your right frontal region and small vessel ischemic change?
Patient: Oh yeah, they found a little bit of blood in my right frontal region and some small vessel ischemic change during the scan. I was feeling dizzy and had a headache for a few days before the scan.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your vision or speech since the scan?
Patient: No, my vision and speech are okay. Sometimes I feel a little off balance, but nothing too bad.
Doctor: Any other symptoms besides dizziness, headache, and off-balance sensation?
Patient: No, my memory and concentration are okay. It's just the dizziness and headache that bother me sometimes. I've also been feeling more anxious and stressed lately because of my cognitive difficulties.
Doctor: Overall, it sounds like we need to investigate further regarding your cognitive and walking issues, as well as the small vessel ischemic change seen on your CT scan. We will schedule some tests and appointments to get a better understanding of what's happening. In the meantime, I can prescribe some medication to help manage your symptoms. 
Patient: Thanks, doc. I really appreciate it.
Doctor: Absolutely. By the way, I've noticed in your medical history that you've had some issues with urinary incontinence and gait impairment. Are you still experiencing those symptoms?
Patient: Yes, unfortunately. They haven't gotten any better.
Doctor: Okay, we'll definitely look into that further during our upcoming evaluations. Also, I recommend scheduling another follow-up appointment in 3 months to check on your progress. Does that work for you?
Patient: Sure, that works for me.
Doctor: Alright, thank you for coming in today. Take care and stay healthy!
Patient: You too, doc. Thanks again."

Mrs. Taylor presents for a follow-up for hypertension. History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.

PLAN

Alcohol use disorder
I will start her on naltrexone which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17. We reviewed side effects and risks. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to the patient.

Hypertension
She will continue taking lisinopril 10 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. Quite possibly her blood pressure will improve significantly if she is able to completely stop consuming alcohol. Target BP is 130-140/70-80. I will see her back week of June 14 which likely will be the time of her second naltrexone injection.

Recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and Shingrix #2, she defers this.

INSTRUCTIONS

Call the clinic with any questions. Make follow up appointment week of June 14th.
","
Doctor: Hey Amanda, how are you feeling today? I see that your BP is currently at 150/100, which is high. What medications are you taking for it?
Patient: I've been prescribed hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril. But I've been experiencing side effects from lisinopril such as headaches, ""swooshing"" in my left ear, and lethargy.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you made any lifestyle changes since your last visit?
Patient: No, but I do admit to consuming alcohol 4-5 times a week. I usually have about 2-3 drinks each time.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It's important to monitor your alcohol consumption as it can affect your blood pressure. Have you considered Naltrexone injections for your alcohol use disorder?
Patient: Yes, I am interested in that.
Doctor: Great, we can discuss that further. Let's check your blood pressure in the morning and evening for the next few days and see if it averages around 135-145 or 150 over 95-110. We'll also run some tests to see if there are any underlying causes for your hypertension. Can you tell me about your blood pressure? Have you been diagnosed with hypertension?
Patient: Yeah, I was diagnosed with hypertension before. It's been pretty stable, but still higher than it should be.
Doctor: How often do you check your blood pressure at home, and have you noticed any significant changes in your readings lately?
Patient: I haven't checked my blood pressure at home. But sometimes I get headaches and feel dizzy.
Doctor: Is there anything that triggers these symptoms or makes them worse?
Patient: Well, I used to drink a lot of alcohol. But I've cut back recently.
Doctor: That's good to hear. How much were you drinking before, and how frequently?
Patient: I used to drink every day, sometimes more than one drink. But now I only drink occasionally.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvements in your symptoms since cutting back on alcohol?
Patient: Yes, I feel better overall. The headaches and dizziness aren't as frequent.
Doctor: That's great to hear. It's important to continue monitoring your blood pressure and avoiding excessive alcohol use to manage your hypertension. Moving on, have you experienced any symptoms of the flu or shingles since deferring your recommended vaccinations?
Patient: Nah, I haven't felt sick or anything like that. I just don't like getting shots, you know?
Doctor: Well, I understand that nobody likes to get shots, but they can be really important for preventing serious illnesses. Would you like to schedule an appointment to get those taken care of? Also, let's work together to come up with a plan to reduce your alcohol consumption and manage your hypertension. It sounds like it's been tough to keep everything under control.
Patient: Yeah, it has been a bit tough.
Doctor: Don't worry, we're here to help. We can discuss the results of your tests next time and continue to monitor your blood pressure. Oh, and one more thing - I see here that you were started on naltrexone for alcohol use disorder. Just a quick check-in, how has that been going for you?
Patient: It's been going pretty well actually. The injectable form makes it easier to stick to.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Keep up the good work, and I'll see you soon."

Full-spectrum sexually transmitted disease testing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing.

The patient states that she is having symptoms of discomfort, a change in discharge, and an odor in her vaginal region. She says that the right side of her vagina is starting to become painful but denies any fever or chills. She states that she recently learned her partner of 3 years has been engaging in sexual encounters with other people for quite some time, and she wants to be evaluated for all sexually transmitted diseases.

Ms. Ross reports noticing a change in the odor, color, and consistency of her vaginal discharge last week. She notes that this did not alarm her until the right side of her vagina became painful and sore, which has not subsided. She states that she had an abnormal Pap Smear around the age of 20, but all her Pap Smears since then, including her most recent one approximately 6 months ago, have all been normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Genitourinary
Pelvic exam: No external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora. Normal physiological discharge with normal color and odor. Cervix is normal, vaginal wall is normal, no cervical motion tenderness or masses noted. Swabs were obtained for sexual transmitted disease testing.

ASSESSMENT

-Screening for sexually transmitted disease.

PLAN

Ms. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing. We will screen her today for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C. Patient is high risk due to an abnormal pap smear in the past and the recent discovery of her sexual partner having multiple partners for some period of time. We will call the patient with the results of the laboratory testing.","

Patient: Yeah, my partner has been seeing other people, so I want to make sure everything is okay.
Doctor: I see. We'll need to run some tests to confirm if there are any infections. Also, have you noticed any changes in your vaginal discharge or odor?
Patient: Actually, yeah. The right side of my vagina hurts, and there are some differences in the discharge and smell.
Doctor: Alright, that's important information. It's possible that you may have contracted an STD or STI, so we'll do some testing to confirm. Besides the discomfort in your vaginal region, have you experienced any physical symptoms?
Patient: No fever or chills, but I've had headaches and confusion at times.
Doctor: Thanks for informing me. These symptoms could be related or unrelated to a potential infection, so we'll keep them in mind as we run our tests. In the meantime, practice safe sex to avoid transmitting anything. And let us know if you notice any abnormal changes in your mood or behavior.
Doctor: How was your pelvic exam?
Patient: They checked everything down there and said it all looked normal. No weird smells or anything. They took swabs to test for diseases though.
Doctor: Good to hear. During the exam, did you feel any pain or discomfort?
Patient: Nope, it didn't hurt at all.
Doctor: Great. According to the notes, there were no external lesions, and your labia majora and minora appeared normal. Your discharge was also typical in color and odor. Did they mention anything specific about your cervix or vaginal wall?
Patient: No, they said both were normal, and there was no cervical motion tenderness or masses noted.
Doctor: Perfect. They also obtained swabs for sexual transmitted disease testing. Have you received those results yet?
Patient: Not yet.
Doctor: Have you been sexually active recently?
Patient: Yes, I have.
Doctor: We'll screen for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C. You're considered high risk due to your previous abnormal Pap Smear and recent discovery of your partner's multiple sexual encounters.
Patient: Okay, got it.
Doctor: We'll call you with the laboratory testing results once we have them. Thank you for coming in today."

Rheumatoid arthritis management.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Nelson is a 72-year-old male who presents today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis. He was last seen by me on 03/04/2021, where he received a steroid injection to his right knee. He continues to experience right knee pain and swelling. The pain level is 6/10. He notes when he stands after he has been sitting for a while, he has to use a cane to ""get his bearings."" The injection he received to the right knee at the last visit was only beneficial for a few weeks. The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not attended physical therapy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Musculoskeletal
Lower right extremity: Swollen right knee, slightly reduced range of motion. Skin warm to touch. Lower right leg pits with pressure.

PROCEDURE

Fluid aspiration and Steroid injection.
Risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained. The risks of steroid injection were explained, including but not limited to, hypopigmentation, soft tissue atrophy, tendon ruptures, and transient hyperglycemia among others. Verbal consent was obtained. The right knee was accessed through the lateral approach with 3 mL of initially clear fluid then blood-tinged fluid. Then the right knee was prepped in a standard fashion. The right knee was injected with 80 mg triamcinolone and 1 mL lidocaine. The procedure was tolerated well with no complications. Post procedure instructions were given.

ASSESSMENT

-Rheumatoid arthritis management.
-High risk medication use.
-Right knee pain.
-Lower extremity pitting edema.

PLAN

Rheumatoid arthritis management.
The patient will continue Xeljanz XR 11 mg daily. He will also continue Celebrex 200 mg daily.

High-risk medication use.
The patient is currently on the high-risk medication Xeljanz. We will check his CMP levels and monitor periodically every couple of months.

Right knee pain.
He has right knee pain and swelling, with pain level 6/10. On exam today, the right knee continues to be hot, which is ongoing inflammation. We performed a fluid aspiration of the right knee today, see procedure note above. A steroid injection to the right knee was given today, see procedure note above. We will arrange for x-ray of the right knee and refer his to physical therapy.

Lower extremity pitting edema.
The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not seen his PCP. We discussed compression stockings, elevate feet, and a low salt diet. He will check with his PCP for further instructions.","Doctor: Hi there! How are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm still managing my rheumatoid arthritis, but I have some concerns about my right knee pain.
Doctor: Okay, let's talk about that. Can you tell me more about your knee pain and when it occurs?
Patient: It's been bothering me for a while now. The pain level is around 6 out of 10, and it's swollen. I usually need to use a cane to get my bearings after sitting for a while.
Doctor: I see. During the exam today, we found ongoing inflammation in your right knee. We performed a fluid aspiration and gave you a steroid injection. We'll also arrange for an x-ray and refer you to physical therapy. Have you tried anything else to alleviate the swelling and pain?
Patient: I wear support hose, but it hasn't helped much.
Doctor: Alright, I recommend trying compression stockings, elevating your feet, and following a low salt diet. And definitely check with your PCP for further instructions. Let's switch gears now and talk about your medications. What are you currently taking for your rheumatoid arthritis?
Patient: I'm taking Xeljanz XR 11 mg and Celebrex 200 mg every day.
Doctor: Great. How have they been working for you?
Patient: They've been really helpful. My joints don't hurt as much, and I can move around more easily.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Just a heads up, Xeljanz is considered a high-risk medication. We'll need to check your CMP levels periodically every couple of months to make sure everything's okay. Is that something you're comfortable with?
Patient: Yes, I understand.
Doctor: Before we end our session, I want to remind you of the risks and benefits associated with any treatments we may pursue. For example, fluid aspiration and steroid injection in your right knee could help alleviate your knee pain, but there are potential side effects such as hypopigmentation, soft tissue atrophy, tendon ruptures, and transient hyperglycemia. Have you fully considered these risks before consenting to the procedure?
Patient: Yes, I understand the risks.
Doctor: Alright then, we can proceed with the treatment plan we discussed. Thank you for coming in today, and we'll see you at your next appointment."

Follow-up for perioral dermatitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Perioral dermatitis.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Doxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.
MetroCream. 
Sulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Integumentary
Skin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.

ASSESSMENT

-Perioral dermatitis
-Rosacea, including ocular rosacea

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist- recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.

PLAN

Perioral dermatitis.
I counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.

Rosacea, including ocular rosacea.
Continue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.

INSTRUCTIONS

Call the clinic if symptoms worsen. The patient will have a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks.","Doctor: Hi Jacqueline, how are you feeling today? Let's talk about your perioral dermatitis. Have you been using doxycycline as prescribed and have you noticed any changes in your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've been applying it twice daily like the doctor told me to. I haven't seen much change yet.
Doctor: Alright, we want to make sure we reach full resolution before reducing the application to once a day for an additional week. Are you planning to resume using Elidel?
Patient: No, I can't afford it without insurance.
Doctor: Okay, no problem. I'll prescribe Tacrolimus instead. Just be aware of any possible side effects while using the medication. Also, continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. How has it been working for you?
Patient: It's been working well. I use it twice a day topically and my skin is not drying out.
Doctor: That's good to hear. So let's switch to Tacrolimus and see if that helps you get rid of perioral dermatitis completely. We will also schedule a follow-up visit to check on your progress.
Patient: Alright, thank you. Now, what about my rosacea, including ocular rosacea? 
Doctor: You mentioned that MetroCream was helping you. Is that still the case?
Patient: Yes, I apply it twice daily and it seems to be controlled.
Doctor: Great! I recommend gently washing your eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and trying a gentle cream like Vanicream. Do you have any other concerns or questions?
Patient: Actually, I've been having some stomach issues lately, and I feel nauseous and weak all the time.
Doctor: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had any headaches or blurred vision recently?
Patient: Yeah, I've been getting these really bad headaches and sometimes my vision gets blurry.
Doctor: Thanks for letting me know. Let's look into those symptoms during our follow-up visit next week. In the meantime, keep taking your medications as directed and don't hesitate to call us if anything worsens. See you next week!
Patient: Sounds good, thanks."

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports enjoying nature photography.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports family history of cholelithiasis. Both of his parents have had cholecystectomies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports low-grade fevers.
Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air.
Body Temperature: Afebrile.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No ectopic beats. No murmurs, clicks, or rubs.

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: Soft, nondistended abdomen. Positive slight guarding to the right upper quadrant, but without rebound tenderness. Positive for Murphy signs. Peritoneal signs not appreciated.
- Auscultation: Bowel sounds normal in all 4 quadrants.

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound obtained at an outside facility is reviewed today. This demonstrates multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder. I do appreciate some mild thickening. The common bile duct size is within normal limits at 4.1 mm.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Mild cholecystitis with gallstones.
- Medical Reasoning: Based on the patient's symptoms, exam findings, and ultrasound, I do believe he has some mild cholecystitis with gallstones. I do not appreciate any frank obstruction, but it looks like his gallbladder is inflamed. This appears to have happened maybe over the last few weeks or since he has been symptomatic.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses of care were described and discussed. I explained the surgery will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, and he will probably spend the night in the hospital for post-procedure monitoring. We also discussed that he should avoid high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are high in fiber. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Since he has not had any improvement with dietary modifications, I recommend a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A mutually agreed upon surgical date has been scheduled for 1 week.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is currently managing his diabetes with diet and exercise.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient he should refrain from hiking in the immediate postoperative period; however, he may return to walking outdoors on solid ground 1 week status post-surgery.
Medical Treatment: I recommended he follow up with his physician regarding his impending surgery. We will continue to monitor his diabetes as has been outlined by either his endocrinologist or his primary care provider.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me 1 week status post-surgery.","Doctor: Hi there! How have you been feeling lately? I see in your notes that you've been experiencing abdominal pain. Can you tell me more about it?
Patient: Yeah, the pain feels like a cramp and it's been coming and going for a few days now. It's located in my stomach area.
Doctor: Okay, got it. And have you been having any other symptoms like nausea or vomiting?
Patient: Yes, actually. I have some sharp pain in my right abdomen with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Doctor: Oh no, that sounds rough. Can you describe the pain in your right abdomen for me?
Patient: It's really sharp and stabbing, and it's making me feel really sick to my stomach.
Doctor: Understood. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or experienced any fever or chills with these symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've had some diarrhea and have been feeling hot and sweaty sometimes.
Doctor: Alright. Let's do some tests to figure out what's going on. Based on your symptoms, I'll order some blood work and imaging studies to check for possible causes such as gallstones or pancreatitis. We'll come up with a treatment plan once we get the results back. Sound good?
Patient: Yes, thank you.
Doctor: I also noticed that your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Have you ever been diagnosed with hypertension?
Patient: Hypertension? I don't think so. What does that mean?
Doctor: Your blood pressure is a little high, which could indicate a risk for developing hypertension. Have you made any changes to your diet or exercise routine lately?
Patient: Not really, I've been eating the same and not exercising much. Should I start doing something different?
Doctor: It might be a good idea to make some lifestyle changes like eating healthier and getting more exercise. Let's monitor your blood pressure and check in again at your next appointment. Oh, and by the way, your oxygen saturation looks great and you're not running a fever!
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. Speaking of my physical examination results, can you tell me what the positive Murphy sign means?
Doctor: Sure thing. A positive Murphy sign indicates inflammation of the gallbladder or blockage of the bile ducts. We'll need to run further tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.
Patient: I also wanted to mention that I've been having some pelvic pain recently. It's been bothering me for a while now and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.
Doctor: That's concerning. Let's schedule another appointment to evaluate this issue further, okay? It could be related to gynecological issues, urinary tract problems, or even musculoskeletal issues.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: No problem. Now, let's talk about the results of your abdominal ultrasound. It shows that you have multiple gallstones in your gallbladder and some mild thickening. However, the size of your common bile duct is within normal limits. This could be causing your symptoms, so we may need to remove your gallbladder through a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We'll discuss the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses of care and schedule the procedure for 1 week from today. Does that sound good?
Patient: Yes, that's fine. 
Doctor: Great. One last thing - how have you been managing your type 2 diabetes?
Patient: I'm watching my diet and trying to exercise more.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Just remember to avoid hiking in the immediate postoperative period, but you can return to walking outdoors on solid ground 1 week after surgery. Make sure to follow up with your physician regarding your impending surgery, and we'll continue to monitor your diabetes as well.
Patient: Okay, thanks for letting me know. 
Doctor: Of course. We'll stay on top of things and get you feeling better soon."

I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg to treat his pain. He will continue with physical therapy and a referral was provided for this today.","Doctor: Hey there, how are you feeling today? Based on your medical records, I see that you've been experiencing some low back pain with decreased flexibility. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
Patient: Actually, I've been having stiffness in my neck as well.
Doctor: Alright, let me take a look at that. First, can you tell me more about your back pain? When did it start and have you tried anything for the pain?
Patient: It started about 4 months ago when I was moving boxes. The pain can be really sharp in my lower back, especially when I move a certain way or roll over in my sleep. But I find relief when I reposition myself. I've tried taking Tylenol and ibuprofen, using heat and ice, but nothing seems to help. Although sometimes the ibuprofen upsets my stomach. And lately, I've been having trouble controlling my bladder.
Doctor: That sounds uncomfortable. Have you tried physical therapy or any other treatments for your pain?
Patient: Yes, I did try physical therapy, but unfortunately it didn't provide any relief. Should I be concerned about the bladder issue?
Doctor: It's definitely something we should keep an eye on. Now let me examine your neck for stiffness. Hmm, I don't feel any pain in the bony protuberance of your C5-C6. Have you noticed any weakness or numbness in your arms or hands?
Patient: No, everything feels normal except for the stiffness in my neck.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. During the examination of your lumbar spine, I did notice some spasm of the paraspinal muscles and a positive straight leg raise. But I also didn't find any pain when palpating your lumbar spine. Is there anything else you'd like me to look at while we're here?
Patient: No, that should be all for now. But I'm worried about the bladder issue. What could be causing it?
Doctor: It's hard to say without further testing, but it could potentially be related to nerve compression from the back pain. We'll need to do some more tests to determine the cause.
Doctor: Hey there, how have you been feeling lately?
Patient: My back has been hurting pretty bad. It's been hard to move around and do things. Physical therapy has helped a little bit.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe the nature of your back pain? Is it sharp or dull, and are there certain activities that exacerbate the pain?
Patient: It's a dull ache that's been there for a while. Sometimes it gets worse when I move around or try to do things, but it's always there.
Doctor: How long have you been experiencing this back pain, and have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs?
Patient: I've been dealing with this back pain for a few weeks now. And yeah, sometimes my legs feel tingly and numb.
Doctor: Have you tried anything else besides physical therapy to manage the pain? And have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms?
Patient: No, physical therapy is the only thing I've tried. It has helped a little bit, but the pain and numbness are still there.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms and medical history, I would like to prescribe meloxicam 15mg to treat the pain. Also, we need to obtain an MRI of your lumbar spine to evaluate for possible acute disc herniation. We should also continue with physical therapy and provide a referral if necessary.

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Scott Miller is a pleasant 36-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The injury occurred 3 days ago, when he was playing pickup soccer games and felt a pop in his right knee. He reports swelling at the time of the injury, which has improved. The patient states that his knee is not as functional or moving as well as it used to be. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 7 out of 10 currently and a 4 to 5 out of 10 when the swelling decreases. The patient has been taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, which provides some relief. He states that he is able to bend his knee with pain towards the end of this motion; however, when he goes to straighten his knee, he feels like he has to help it straight. The patient adds that he is able to bear weight on his right knee, however it feels loose and does not feel normal.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works at a desk.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: Marked limp in the right leg upon ambulation.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Significant effusion. Slight ecchymosis. Pain with palpation at the medial joint line. Difficulty with passive ROM. Lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to 115 degrees. Lacking 20-30 degrees of terminal flexion secondary to pain. Positive Lachman's test. Muscle strength is 5/5. Neurovascular intact distally.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible anterior cruciate ligament tear.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate the integrity of the ACL. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg a day to reduce swelling and pain. We discussed that the patient should utilize ice and activity modification to reduce swelling and pain. I recommended that he wears a knee immobilizer and use crutches when he is ambulating. He will avoid jogging until we have the results of his MRI.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.","
Doctor: Hey there, how are you feeling today? I see that your chief complaint is a knee injury. Can you tell me more about what happened and how it's been feeling lately?
Patient: Yeah, I twisted my right knee while playing basketball with friends about two weeks ago. It's been swelling and hurting since then. And just three days ago, I felt a pop in my knee while playing soccer. The pain is still around 6-7 out of 10 currently.
Doctor: That sounds painful. Have you tried anything to help alleviate the pain and swelling?
Patient: I've been using ibuprofen for some relief. But I'm still having trouble bending my knee or putting weight on it.
Doctor: Okay, we'll need to evaluate your knee to determine the extent of the injury. How has your knee been affecting your daily activities and work?
Patient: It's been difficult to walk or stand for long periods of time, which makes it hard to focus at work.
Doctor: I understand. Based on our physical examination, I noticed some effusion and slight bruising around the joint. Did you experience any pain during palpation or difficulty moving your leg in certain ways?
Patient: Yes, it was quite painful when you pressed on the medial joint line. And I can't fully extend or flex my leg because of the pain.
Doctor: Thank you for letting me know. I also performed a Lachman's test, which came back positive for instability. Based on these findings, it's possible that you may have an anterior cruciate ligament tear. We will need to get an MRI to confirm this diagnosis.
Patient: Alright, what should I do until the MRI results come back?
Doctor: I recommend utilizing ice and activity modification to reduce swelling and pain. You should also wear a knee immobilizer and use crutches when ambulating to take pressure off your knee. And avoid jogging until we receive the MRI results.
Patient: Okay, got it.
Doctor: Additionally, I noticed that you spend a lot of time using a mouse or typing on a keyboard for work. Have you experienced any discomfort or pain in your hands or arms from doing those activities?
Patient: Yes, I've been experiencing some pain and stiffness in my hands and wrists.
Doctor: Alright, we can discuss some treatment options for carpal tunnel syndrome during your examination as well. Lastly, have you noticed any changes in your health recently, since your last visit?
Patient: No, everything has been pretty much the same.
Doctor: Alright. Let's schedule an appointment for your examination and MRI. In the meantime, I'll prescribe meloxicam 15 mg a day to reduce swelling and pain. Sound good?
Patient: Sounds great. Thanks, Doctor."

2. Diabetes type 2.
3. Hypertension.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with her regarding her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her elbow pain is consistent with medial epicondylitis and was most likely caused by overuse and damage to the tendons in her arm. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient will wear a sling on her right arm while she is awake to provide increased support. I advised her to ice her right elbow for 20 minutes 3 times per day. She will take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for 1 week. I have also advised her to hold off on creating pottery for the next 2 weeks to allow her arm to heal. If the patient continues to experience persistent elbow pain, we may consider formal physical therapy at her next visit.

I have encouraged the patient to check and record her blood sugars every day. I will increase her metformin to 1000 mg twice a day. The patient and I discussed the importance of her taking her medication on a regular basis twice a day. I have also recommended that she be referred to diabetic counseling for more information on the steps she can take to manage her diabetes. I will also order a hemoglobin A1c test for a more accurate assessment of her long-term blood sugar levels.

The patient- hypertension is currently controlled with medication and exercise. I have instructed her to continue taking lisinopril 10 mg. I also encouraged her to continue with her walking routine.

All questions were answered.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review the results of the hemoglobin A1c test and discuss her progress.","Doctor: Hey there, how are you feeling today? I see that you've been experiencing pain in your right elbow. Can you describe the type of pain you've been feeling?
Patient: It hurts when I move my arm or try to lift things. Feels like a sharp pain sometimes and other times it's more of a dull ache.
Doctor: Okay, based on your symptoms, it sounds like you may be experiencing medial epicondylitis (also known as golfer's elbow). I'll recommend some treatments such as rest, ice, and physical therapy. Does that sound good to you?
Patient: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you for your help. What is your current blood pressure reading and how has it been trending recently? I know you mentioned that you've been diagnosed with diabetes type 2 as well.
Doctor: Well, my blood pressure has been high for a while now, but I'm not sure what the exact number is. It's been fluctuating a lot. The doctor put me on Lisinopril 10 mg for it, and I haven't had any issues with my Metformin 500 mg twice daily for my diabetes. Have you been experiencing any symptoms related to your blood pressure, such as headaches or dizziness?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes I get headaches when my blood pressure spikes.
Doctor: Understood. We'll make sure to monitor your blood pressure more closely moving forward and adjust your medication if necessary. And back to your elbow pain, let's schedule some physical therapy sessions to help alleviate your symptoms. I see that you've been experiencing some pain in your right forearm and wrist lately. When did you first start experiencing the pain in your right forearm and wrist?
Patient: I think it started a few days ago. It just came out of nowhere.
Doctor: Alright. Let me take a look here. Can you tell me if you've experienced any recent trauma or injury to your right forearm and wrist?
Patient: Actually, now that you mention it, no. I haven't had any recent injuries or accidents. 
Doctor: Okay. Let me check your cardiovascular system real quick. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Pulses are equal bilaterally. Now let's move on to your respiratory system. Normal respiratory effort, no respiratory distress. Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation. Moving on to your skin, I don't see any rash or lesions. Finally, with regards to your musculoskeletal system, I can see moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. You also seem to be experiencing pain with resisted pronation of the right forearm as well as with flexion and bending of the right wrist. However, I don't see any bruising, swelling or discoloration or lesions.
Patient: Thank you for checking. So what could be causing this pain in my right forearm and wrist?
Doctor: Based on what I'm seeing, it seems like you might be experiencing some inflammation in your tendons or muscles. This could be due to overuse or repetitive movements. I'll recommend some rest and ice, as well as physical therapy exercises to help alleviate your symptoms. If the pain persists, we can run some further tests to see if there's any underlying damage or injury. And by the way, I noticed on your latest EKG that you have sinus tachycardia. Have you been experiencing any symptoms related to that, such as chest pain, fatigue, or shortness of breath?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any other symptoms besides the faster heart rate.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you made any changes to your daily routine, diet, or stress levels that may contribute to the sinus tachycardia?
Patient: Well, I've been eating healthier and managing my stress better, but I don't think those changes would cause this.
Doctor: I see. Do you drink caffeine or smoke? And do you notice any connection between their use and your faster heart rate?
Patient: I have coffee in the morning, but I haven't noticed it impacting my heart rate. I don't smoke or use nicotine products.
Doctor: Got it. Let's keep an eye on your heart rate and continue monitoring your blood pressure and diabetes as well. We'll work together to come up with a treatment plan that works best for you. How have you been doing with the conservative treatment we recommended for your medial epicondylitis?
Patient: It's been okay. I wear the sling and ice my elbow twice a day like you told me to, and I've been taking ibuprofen as well.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you noticed any improvements in your pain or range of motion since starting the treatment?
Patient: Yeah, the pain is not as bad as before and I can move my arm a little more easily now.
Doctor: Are you experiencing any side effects from the ibuprofen or other medications you are taking?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed anything so far.
Doctor: Have you scheduled your appointments with the physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy at Siskin Rehab Hospital yet?
Patient: No, not yet. You said the patient coordinator would give me a call within two days to set it up.
Doctor: Okay, make sure to schedule those appointments as soon as possible. Also, we're referring you for diabetic counseling and increasing your metformin dosage. How do you feel about that?
Patient: Alright, I'll do whatever it takes to manage my diabetes.
Doctor: Good attitude! We'll follow up with you in two weeks to review your hemoglobin A1c test and progress. Keep up with the prescribed treatment plan until then.
Patient: Will do, thanks for all your help."

Patient: Yes, I've been experiencing some burning pain and decreased sensation in my foot. The wound has gotten bigger and redder over time, and sometimes it drains pus and blood. There's some swelling around the area too.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It sounds like we'll need to take a closer look at the wound and develop a treatment plan for it. And I also see that you have diabetes and neuropathy, which could be contributing to the difficulty in healing the ulcer. What are your blood sugar levels usually like?
Patient: They're usually in the 200's, and my last hemoglobin A1C was 10.

Patient: Yes, I feel tired pretty much all the time, and it's been hard to keep up with everything. Sometimes I even have trouble getting out of bed in the morning. It seems to just be there all the time, and I haven't noticed any particular triggers.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. We'll want to investigate the cause of your fatigue further, but for now let's focus on treating the foot ulcer. I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics and suggest some lifestyle changes to help improve the healing process. And in terms of managing your diabetes, we'll recommend some dietary changes and possibly medication adjustments. Does that sound okay?
Patient: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: Of course. And before you go, I also wanted to mention that your vitals are looking good today, so keep up the good work taking care of yourself.
Doctor: Can you describe the appearance of the wound on your right foot?
Patient: There's a wound on the top side of my right foot, near the pinky toe. It's about an inch long and two inches wide.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in the wound, such as size or depth? And have you experienced any increased pain or difficulty walking?

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: No carotid bruits. A 3/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard at the left base.
- Examination: Right radial artery cath site is clean, dry, and intact without hematoma. Radial artery pulses are palpable.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Bilateral lower limb edema. Pitting 1+.

RESULTS

EKG is reviewed and demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm. Good R wave progression. Evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a STEMI.

Echocardiogram is reviewed and demonstrates a reduced ejection fraction of 35%.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease that we will continue to monitor.
- Medical Treatment: She will continue aspirin 81 mg daily and Brilinta 90 mg twice daily. She will continue Lipitor 80 mg a day and Toprol 50 mg daily. I am going to refer her to cardiac rehab for education and to gain confidence to resume exercising regularly.

2. Newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation.
- Medical Reasoning: A recent echocardiogram revealed a reduced ejection fraction of 35%. She was able to be treated in the cath lab in a timely manner, so I think that the muscle is just stunned. Given her history. it will improve over time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient that she will recover since she is compliant with her medications.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily.

3. Acute heart failure.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is retaining fluid.

4. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Blood pressure is well controlled. She will tolerate the Aldactone well.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue exercising and to be cognizant of her diet. I explained that there are healthier alternatives available to reduce the amount of preserved meats she consumes.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily. The patient received a referral to nutrition counseling to consider what other diet options might be available to her.

5. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue monitoring her blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin as prescribed.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up as instructed.","
Doctor: Hi there! How have you been feeling since our last visit?
Patient: I've been doing okay, thanks.
Doctor: Great! Let's talk about your current medication regimen. Have there been any changes made to your medications since we last spoke?
Patient: No, I don't think so. But my memory isn't great, so I'm not entirely sure.
Doctor: That's alright, I'll double-check. From what I see in your records, you're taking aspirin 81 mg daily, Brilinta 90 mg twice daily, Lipitor 80 mg daily, Toprol 50 mg daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, and metformin for your Type 2 diabetes. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that sounds right.
Doctor: Okay, now let's review your symptoms. Have you experienced any chest pain or shortness of breath lately?
Patient: No, I haven't experienced either of those symptoms.
Doctor: That's good to hear. You did mention bilateral leg swelling. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: My legs have been swollen for a little while now.
Doctor: Alright, I'll note that down. Moving on to your physical exam, I see that your vitals are within normal limits. Your cardiovascular system appears to be functioning well, with no jugular venous distention or carotid bruits. However, I do hear a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left base.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: The murmur indicates some turbulence in blood flow through your heart. It's possible that it could be related to your coronary artery disease or newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction. We may need to further evaluate that with an echocardiogram. Also, I noticed you have bilateral lower limb edema with pitting.
Patient: Yes, I've had that for a while.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you're retaining fluid, which could indicate acute heart failure. To treat this, I'm going to prescribe Lasix 40 mg once a day and Aldactone 12.5 mg daily. We'll also order lab work and obtain a repeat echo in approximately 2 months. Does that sound good?
Patient: Yes, thank you.
Doctor: Lastly, let's discuss your hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. Your blood pressure is currently well controlled, but I did notice that you consume a lot of preserved meats. I recommend seeking nutrition counseling to consider healthier alternatives. As for your diabetes, continue monitoring your blood glucose levels and taking metformin as prescribed.
Patient: Okay, I will do that.
Doctor: Great. Finally, I want to refer you to cardiac rehab for education and encouragement to resume exercising regularly. Remember, managing your health is a team effort and we're here to support you every step of the way."

Patient: Honestly, I haven't been checking my blood sugar much and I haven't really changed my diet either. I've tried to eat more veggies and less sugar though.
Doctor: It's important to stay on top of your diabetes management. Have you been experiencing any side effects from your medications?
Patient: No, everything seems to be going okay so far.
Doctor: Awesome, glad to hear it. You had a heart attack in the past - can you tell me what treatments you've received for that and why you're taking each medication?
Patient: Sure, I take aspirin for my heart and Brilinta helps prevent blood clots. The fish oil supplement is supposed to lower cholesterol, and Crestor does the same thing. Finally, Metoprolol controls my blood pressure.
Doctor: Good job remembering all of those! Can you explain why you were prescribed both aspirin and Brilinta?
Patient: Aspirin is for my heart, and Brilinta helps prevent blood clots.

Doctor: That's good to hear. Overall, how would you say your experience has been with these medications in terms of consistency, symptom management, and side effects?
Patient: It's been mostly positive. I try to take everything as prescribed and they do help me manage my conditions. The side effects are minimal and manageable.
Doctor: I see. Now, I also noticed that you recently experienced a sharp pain in your stomach area. Can you tell me more about that?

Right hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alexis Gutierrez is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right hand pain.

Approximately 6 months ago, the patient began experiencing intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on her right hand. The numbness and tingling has become constant over the past month or so and is accompanied by pain with typing and using a mouse, which she does all day while working on a keyboard. She denies any sleep disturbance associated with her symptoms. Rest and ibuprofen have been the most helpful at providing symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she works on a keyboard all day.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies sleep disturbance.
Musculoskeletal: Reports pain in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.
Neurological: Reports numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right hand: Pain with flexion and extension of the wrist.. Decreased grip strength on the right compared to the left. Positive Tinel's sign.

ASSESSMENT

Right carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing her symptoms and exam findings, I believe her symptoms are secondary to carpal tunnel syndrome. We discussed the nature of this condition, as well as her treatment options, in detail. I recommend we treat this conservatively with nighttime wrist splinting and ibuprofen, but I want to increase her dose to 600 mg 4 times daily. I'm also going to order an EMG/Nerve conduction study for further evaluation. If this is positive, we can consider additional treatment with physical therapy or surgical intervention with carpal tunnel release.","Doctor: Hi there, Alexis! How are you feeling today?
Patient: Hello, Doctor. I'm doing okay.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain in your right hand? When did it start and how would you describe it?
Patient: It started about six months ago with occasional numbness and tingling in my first three fingers on the right hand. But now the pain is constant and feels sharp when typing or using a mouse. Sometimes I wake up at night because of the pain too.
Doctor: That's tough to deal with. Have you noticed any changes in your daily activities or quality of life due to the pain and numbness in your fingers?
Patient: Yeah, it's been hard to do things that require fine motor skills like typing, writing, or even cooking. And I feel frustrated when I can't hold onto objects properly.
Doctor: I understand. Have you tried anything other than ibuprofen and rest for relief?
Patient: No, not really. Sometimes I try to shake out my hand or stretch it, but it doesn't help much.
Doctor: I see. Let's take a closer look at your symptoms. Have you experienced any weakness or loss of grip strength in your affected hand, and has the numbness and tingling spread to other areas?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any weakness or loss of grip strength. The numbness and tingling have only been in my first three fingers on my right hand.
Doctor: Okay, thanks for letting me know. During our physical exam, I noticed some decreased grip strength on your right compared to your left side. I also performed a Tinel's sign test to check for nerve irritation, which was positive. Based on your symptoms and findings, it's possible that you have carpal tunnel syndrome. I want to order an EMG/Nerve conduction study to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of it.
Patient: Okay, what kind of treatment options are available if it is carpal tunnel syndrome?
Doctor: If we confirm the diagnosis, we can start with nighttime wrist splinting and increasing your dose of ibuprofen to 600 mg four times daily for symptomatic relief. Physical therapy may be recommended as well. In severe cases, surgical intervention with carpal tunnel release may be necessary. 
Patient: Alright, thank you. Is there anything else I should be doing to manage my symptoms?
Doctor: While we investigate further, try to avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms and take frequent breaks when using your hands for extended periods of time. We'll discuss more once we get your test results back."

RESULTS

EKG was obtained and reviewed in office today and is unremarkable. Hemoglobin A1c: 7.0

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Chest pain.
- Medical Reasoning: Considering her history of diabetes, possible history of hypertension, and family history of heart disease, I suspect her chest pain is likely unstable angina. Her recent EKG was unremarkable and there are no other signs of heart attack, but I am worried she may have some sort of a blockage causing her pain.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed proper protocol for sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain. I advised her to go to the emergency department if the medication is not effective after approximately 5 minutes.
- Medical Treatment: We will have her start a regimen of baby aspirin at 81 mg daily, for which I have sent in a prescription today. I also sent a prescription for nitroglycerin up to 3 tablets every 5 minutes as needed. Finally, I am going to have her follow up with cardiology for further evaluation.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: She appears to be doing well on her current regimen.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to keep her appointment with ophthalmology for evaluation of diabetic retinopathy.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to put in an order for a repeat hemoglobin A1c to check for any needed medication adjustments and have her follow up in 2 weeks. In the meantime, I want her to continue with metformin 500 mg twice daily and dietary modifications.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Several providers, including myself, have noted a trend of elevated blood pressures in the patient's chart.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor her blood pressures at home over the next 2 weeks and report her readings to me via MyChart. This should help us determine if any adjustments need to be made to her new medications. We discussed the possible side effects of hydrochlorothiazide how this will hopefully reduce some of her swelling seen on physical exam. All of her questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to have her start hydrochlorothiazide at a low dose.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","Doctor: Good to see you again. Have you been experiencing any chest pain when you're doing physical activities like walking or climbing stairs?

Doctor: That's possible.
Doctor: Have you noticed any other symptoms that could be related to high blood pressure, such as blurred vision or shortness of breath?
Patient: Sometimes my vision gets blurry, but I thought it was just from staring at screens too long. And I do feel a little out of breath when doing physical activities.
Doctor: Okay, those are important symptoms to note.
Doctor: Have you been monitoring your blood pressure at home or have you had it checked recently at a clinic?
Patient: No, I haven't checked it lately. Should I be doing that?

Doctor: Moving on to your Type 2 diabetes, it seems that you are doing well on your current regimen. However, I recommend that you keep your appointment with ophthalmology for an evaluation of diabetic retinopathy.
Doctor: Also, let's order another hemoglobin A1c to check if we need to make any adjustments to your medication. For now, continue taking metformin 500 mg twice daily and making dietary modifications.
Doctor: Lastly, I noticed that your blood pressures have been elevated recently. Please monitor your readings at home and report them via MyChart.
Doctor: We also need to discuss possible side effects of hydrochlorothiazide. I'm going to prescribe it at a low dose to help manage your hypertension.
Patient: Understood, thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
Doctor: What is your current diet and exercise routine? Specifically, how often are you consuming fruits and vegetables, what types of proteins are you eating, and how frequently do you exercise?
Patient: I try to eat healthy and I exercise sometimes.

I encouraged her to take running easy for now. She can continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatories as needed for pain. All questions were answered.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me soon.","Doctor: Hi there! So, I see in your notes that you've been experiencing bilateral knee pain. Can you tell me more about what activities or movements seem to aggravate the pain?
Patient: Yeah, it's mostly when I walk or stand for too long, and going up and down stairs can be especially bad. Even just bending my knees or squatting can hurt too.
Doctor: I see. And how severe is the pain during these activities? Does it last after you stop?
Patient: The pain can be pretty bad, like a sharp ache that makes it hard to keep going. Sometimes it feels like my knees are creaking. The pain gets worse when I transition from sitting to standing or when I go up or down stairs.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. Thank you for explaining that. We'll work together to find some solutions for managing your knee pain. How would you describe the pain in your knees?
Patient: It's like a deep, achy pain in the back of my knees. Sometimes they feel like they're ""creaking."" The pain gets worse when I transition from sitting to standing or when I go up or down stairs.
Doctor: Alright, based on your symptoms, I'll write down ""bilateral knee pain and crepitus"" in your chart. We'll need to take a closer look at what might be causing your pain. Have you tried taking any over-the-counter pain relievers for your knee pain?
Patient: Yes, I took some ibuprofen, but it didn't really help much.
Doctor: Okay. Now, do you happen to know if anyone in your family has a history of kidney disease or thyroid disorders? We noticed some abnormal levels in your recent labs.
Patient: Honestly, I'm not sure about that. My mom has high blood pressure but I don't know if that's related to those things.
Doctor: Okay, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, weight, or energy levels lately? These could be related to the abnormal thyroid levels we saw.
Patient: Not really, I feel pretty normal overall. My appetite and energy levels seem to be about the same as usual.
Doctor: Understood. Finally, do you know if heart disease runs in your family at all? We noticed some sinus tachycardia on your EKG.
Patient: Hmm, I'm not really sure. I know my grandma had high blood pressure, but I don't know if that means there's a history of heart disease too.
Doctor: Okay, no problem. And have you noticed any symptoms such as muscle weakness, tremors, or difficulty sleeping related to your abnormal thyroid levels?
Patient: Nope, none of those things. I've been sleeping well and my muscles feel normal.
Doctor: Can you describe the location and severity of the pain in your knees when you experience tenderness on palpation or a positive patellar grind test?
Patient: The pain is in my knees and it hurts when you press on them or when you do that patellar grind thing. It's been hard to squat because of the pain.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any deformity in your legs or any issues with your walking or gait?
Patient: No, everything seems normal in terms of my walking and there are no deformities that I know of.
Doctor: That's good to hear. On another note, during our examination, we checked for any cardiovascular issues and found that your heart rate and rhythm are regular with no murmurs. We also did some neurological testing and found symmetrical reflexes. Additionally, we didn't notice any swelling in your legs or feet. Lastly, our musculoskeletal examination revealed some tenderness to palpation in your bilateral retinaculum, as well as a positive patellar grind test. We also noticed some knee pain when you were squatting. However, all other tests, such as the Lachman test, anterior and posterior drawer tests, and McMurray test, were negative bilaterally.
Patient: What recommendations do you have for managing my fatigue and low iron levels, and how will physical therapy help with my mobility and running mechanics?
Doctor: We can start with some conservative treatments such as iron supplements to help improve your iron levels and combat fatigue. For your mobility and running mechanics, we'll focus on formal physical therapy sessions that include exercises to increase lower extremity strength and mobility, as well as drills to correct your running form. It's important to take it easy for now and not push yourself too hard during exercise. You can also continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatories as needed for pain.

Neurological: Denies bowl or bladder control issues, numbness, tingling, decreased sensations, or weakness.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 130/70 mm Hg.
Respiratory rate: 18.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: I do not appreciate any murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
RESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Clear to auscultation, bilaterally.
BACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity
NEURO: Normal sensation. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No ecchymosis noted. Midline tenderness at the L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion. Positive supine straight leg test.

The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. It revealed disc desiccation and a disc bulge with a paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis.

ASSESSMENT

Lumbar back pain at the L4-5 disc space due to a herniated disc with radiculopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I have discussed with the patient that his MRI revealed a herniated disc with radiculopathy. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of a corticosteroid injection. With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a corticosteroid injection into the lumbar spine today. The patient was made aware of the risks of bleeding, infection, nerve damage, blood vessel damage, reaction to the medication, including skin changes, swelling, and also, the risk of elevated glucose levels if the patient were diabetic.","Doctor: Hi there! How are you feeling today?
Patient: Not so great, my lower back has been hurting a lot lately.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the pain? When did it start and what kind of pain is it?
Patient: It started about 2 weeks ago and it's an aching pain that sometimes feels sharp. It's been getting worse and it's now radiating down my left leg.
Doctor: I see. Have you tried any over-the-counter pain relievers for the pain?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol but they don't seem to be helping much.
Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your leg? And have you experienced any weakness or loss of sensation in your leg?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling, but my leg does feel weak sometimes.
Doctor: I understand. Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have a herniated disc in your lower back. Have you had any previous episodes of back pain in the past?
Patient: Yeah, I've had some occasional back pain before but this feels different.
Doctor: Got it. Have you experienced any difficulty with bowel or bladder function?
Patient: No, everything seems to be normal in that regard.
Doctor: That's good to hear. I also noticed from your medical history that you have a sedentary job where you sit most of the time. Do you take breaks and stretch throughout the day?
Patient: Not really, I try to exercise inconsistently though.
Doctor: I understand. It's important to take breaks and stretch throughout the day to avoid exacerbating the pain. Based on your physical exam and MRI results, it appears that you have a herniated disc in your lower back that's causing the pain and possibly affecting the nerves in your leg. We can explore treatment options such as physical therapy or medication to manage the pain and prevent any further damage. In the meantime, you can try using heat or ice therapy to alleviate the discomfort. Any questions so far?
Patient: No, not really. What are the treatment options?
Doctor: Well, we could try corticosteroid injections into your lower back to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. However, it's important to note that there are risks involved, such as bleeding, infection, nerve damage, and skin changes. If you're diabetic, there's also a risk of elevated glucose levels. We can discuss other options if you prefer.
Patient: I'll try the injection. What do I need to know before we get started?
Doctor: Great. I just want to make sure you're aware of the risks involved and that we'll be monitoring you carefully during and after the injection. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
Patient: No, let's do it."

Doctor: Good, but please avoid ibuprofen because of your ulcer. We'll work together to find a treatment plan that works best for you. Based on your symptoms and medical history, may I examine your left knee?
Patient: Sure.
Doctor: (examines patient's left knee) I see some fluid buildup and swelling in the joint. Do you experience pain when you move your knee?
Patient: Yes, it hurts when I try to bend or straighten it.
Doctor: I will perform a few tests to check for any ligament tears or meniscus injuries. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort during these tests. (performs Lachman's test) Okay, that was negative. Let's try a valgus and varus stress test. (performs test) That's also negative.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: After examining you, it seems like you have edema and effusion in your left knee, with moderate range of motion and pain during flexion and extension. There is no evidence of ligament tears or meniscus injuries, which is good news. However, we still need to determine the underlying cause of your knee pain and stiffness. Would you consider scheduling an imaging test such as an X-ray or MRI?
Patient: Yes, I would definitely consider it.
Doctor: Excellent. In the meantime, I suggest rest and ice therapy to reduce the swelling and pain. Once we have a clear diagnosis, we can explore options such as physical therapy or pain medication. How do you feel about that?
Patient: Sounds like a plan. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: Given your current condition, I recommend conservative treatment for your knee. For the next week, use a knee immobilizer for increased support. Additionally, I have prescribed Tramadol 50 mg for your pain, and Tylenol for any breakthrough pain that may occur.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. Is there anything else I can do to manage my knee pain?
Doctor: Yes, apply ice to your left knee 3-4 times a day for 20-30 minutes. And for the next 3 weeks, don't run or engage in high-intensity activities that could irritate your knee.
Patient: Alright, thank you. What should I do if the immobilizer doesn't help with the pain?
Doctor: If the knee pain persists despite wearing the immobilizer, then we may need to conduct an MRI to further investigate the issue."
