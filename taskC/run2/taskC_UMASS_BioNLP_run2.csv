Patient: Will do, thanks.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient: My osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little lately, especially in my elbows.
Doctor: I see. Have you been sitting at the computer more in the office?
Patient: Yes, that's probably it. I'm typing all day instead of writing.
Doctor: Does your sitting position bother your osteoarthritis a little?
Patient: It might be. My right elbow bothers me more than my left one.
Doctor: Do you experience any joint pain besides your elbows?
Patient: No, just occasional numbness and tingling in my hands. I try to shake my arms to relieve it.
Doctor: How about your gout, have you had any flare-ups or inflammation recently?
Patient: Not since my last episode about 3 months ago. The medication worked well for me.
Doctor: That's good to hear. How is your psoriasis doing?
Patient: It's under control and hasn't been a major problem.
Doctor: Are you still taking colchicine for your gout?
Patient: Yes, I'm still on it twice a day as needed for flare-ups.
Doctor: Thank you for letting me know. Is there anything else you want to discuss regarding your conditions?
Patient: No, that's all for now.

Doctor: And have you tried anything to alleviate the pain, like using a heating pad or taking aspirin?
Patient: Not really, I haven't tried any treatments yet.
Doctor: Okay, we can explore some options later on. I also noticed that you've been experiencing numbness and tingling. Can you describe that sensation for me?
Patient: It feels like my hands and feet fall asleep a lot.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in the numbness and tingling over the past few days?
Patient: No, it's been pretty consistent.
Doctor: Alright, let's keep an eye on that. Are there any other symptoms you've been experiencing recently?
Patient: Not really, just the joint pain and numbness/tingling.
Doctor: Okay, we'll focus on addressing those issues then.
Doctor: Let's start with your physical exam. Your neck feels supple without any signs of lymphadenopathy. Moving on to your respiratory exam, your lungs sound clear and I didn't detect any wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. 
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: Your cardiovascular system seems to be functioning normally with a regular rate and rhythm. Now, let's examine your abdomen. 
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press on different areas? 
Patient: Actually, there is some tenderness in my right abdomen.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Moving on to your musculoskeletal exam, I noticed some edema and inflammation on your right elbow.

Doctor: Got it. And are you experiencing any pain in other areas of your body? 
Patient: My stomach feels sore when you press on it, but no sharp pain or anything like that. 
Doctor: Understood. Lastly, let's check your lymph nodes. Have you noticed any swelling or tenderness in your neck, armpits, or groin area? 
Patient: No, everything feels normal there.

Doctor: How has the medical treatment for your psoriasis been going? Have you noticed any improvement in symptoms since the last time we talked?
Patient: Unfortunately, no. The cream just doesn't seem to be doing enough.
Doctor: Okay, let's keep an eye on that. Now, have you experienced any gout attacks since our last appointment?
Patient: Sorry, I think you got the wrong patient. I don't have gout.
Doctor: How has the meloxicam treatment been working for your osteoarthritis pain and swelling?
Patient: Well, actually, I forgot to mention that my left leg has been more swollen than the right one."

Patient: Umm...I don't remember exactly. Maybe a year ago?

Patient: No, nothing else comes to mind.
Doctor: Alright, let's focus on addressing your back pain today. Can you provide any additional details or concerns about your back pain that you want us to address?

Patient: No, I think that's everything. Thank you. 
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. But I was just curious about what Hemoglobin A1c means.

Patient: Oh, I get it now. No, I haven't noticed any changes in my body.

Patient:No, I haven't experienced any other symptoms.

Doctor: And how have you been doing with cutting back on those sweets?
Patient: It's been tough, sometimes I just can't resist them.
Doctor: Understood. How about your hypertension since starting lisinopril?
Patient: I haven't noticed any changes or symptoms related to my hypertension.
Doctor: And how has your fasting blood glucose been since we last checked your hemoglobin A1c which was elevated?
Patient: I'm not sure, but I haven't been feeling worse. Is there anything else I should be doing to manage my diabetes?
Doctor: Yes, I encourage you to check your fasting blood glucose levels each morning and call us in about 2 weeks. We'll follow up in about 2 months to discuss further treatment recommendations based on your progress.
Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to do that.
Doctor: Lastly, how has your hypertension been managed since being admitted for diabetes mellitus type 2 two months ago?
Patient: I've been taking my medication as prescribed, and my doctor said my blood pressure has been okay.

Patient: Yeah, they basically fused two of my lower back bones together to relieve some pain.
Doctor: Ah, got it. Can you provide me with more details on the procedure itself?
Patient: Sure thing. They made a cut in my back and put some screws and rods to fuse the vertebrae. 
Doctor: Okay, thank you for explaining. Can you walk me through the recovery process after the surgery?
Patient: It was pretty tough. I had to wear a back brace and take it easy for a while.

Doctor: Okay. Can you describe how your right knee pain is presenting currently?
Patient: It's been causing discomfort and limiting my mobility. It hurts when I try to walk or stand for a long time.
Doctor: Got it. How would you describe the type of pain you're experiencing in your right knee?
Patient: It's like a sharp ache that comes and goes. Sometimes it feels like a throbbing pain.
Doctor: Alright. Have you had an evaluation for Chondromalacia of your right patella?
Patient: No, not yet.
Doctor: Well, based on your medical history and exam today, I'd like to prescribe ibuprofen 600 mg four times a day with food to help manage the pain. Additionally, I want you to do some straight leg raising exercises that will strengthen your quadriceps. Is that okay with you?
Patient: Yes, that sounds good.

Doctor: How would you say you're presenting with regard to your joint pain and any other symptoms?
Patient: My main concern is the joint pain in my knees. It's been bothering me and affecting my daily activities. Other than that, everything seems to be okay.
Doctor: Thanks for sharing that with me. Is there anything else you want to discuss during this appointment?
Patient: No, just my knee pain and finding ways to manage it.
Doctor: Hi there! How are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm doing alright, thanks for asking.
Doctor: Have you noticed any stiffness or limited range of motion in your knees?
Patient: No, my knees feel fine.
Doctor: Have you been experiencing any joint pain?

Patient: No, I haven't had any chest pain or swelling in my legs.
Doctor: Any recent positive findings in your medical history?
Patient: No, I don't think so.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your general health recently?
Patient: Not really, just trying to stay healthy and take care of myself.
Doctor: Great. Now let's do a physical exam. I'm going to check your lungs first. Take a deep breath for me.
Patient: (takes deep breath)
Doctor: Okay, your lungs sound clear bilaterally with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Now onto your heart. (listens to heart) Your heart sounds regular with a good rhythm.
Patient: That's good to know.
Doctor: Now let's move on to your musculoskeletal system. I see some slight erythema and edema on your left knee with a small effusion present. How has it been feeling?
Patient: It's been a little painful and hard to move around sometimes.
Doctor: I can see that. You also have decreased flexion and extension. However, your strength in your lower extremities is good. We'll need to keep an eye on this and possibly do some imaging tests to determine the cause of the inflammation.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Overall, it seems like you're doing pretty well. Is there anything else you want to discuss or any concerns you have?
Patient: No, I think that covers everything for now.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Doctor: I understand your concern about your bones, but before we discuss that, can you tell me if you are experiencing any other symptoms?
Doctor: That's right. However, have you noticed any other abnormalities or changes in your knee pain besides the swelling and inflammation we talked about earlier?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed anything else.
Doctor: Okay, got it. Have you been experiencing any pain or discomfort in your knee? 
Patient: Yeah, my knee hurts a lot and it's pretty swollen.
Doctor: I see. How has your knee pain been since our last visit? Any improvement or worsening?
Patient: It's still hurting a lot and hasn't gotten any better.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. How has the pain been affecting your daily activities?
Patient: Well, it's been hard to walk and stand for too long. It's definitely been affecting my mobility.
Doctor: I understand. Have you been taking any pain medication for your knee?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking ibuprofen to help with the pain.
Doctor: Good to know. Has the swelling in your knee improved at all?
Patient: No, it hasn't really gone down much.
Doctor: I see. Has the location or intensity of your knee pain changed since our last visit?

Doctor: Okay, thanks for letting me know. Has the frequency of your knee pain changed since our last visit?
Patient: No, it still hurts all the time.
Doctor: I see. How has the pain been affecting your sleep? Have you noticed any difficulty sleeping due to the pain in your knee?
Patient: Yeah, it's definitely been affecting my sleep. Sometimes it's hard to get comfortable because of the pain.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Has there been any improvement in your knee pain since our last visit?
Patient: No, unfortunately not.
Doctor: Okay, got it. How has your knee pain been over the past few days? Any changes or improvements?
Patient: It's been about the same as before - still hurting a lot and swollen.
Doctor: Understood. Has the intensity of your knee pain increased or decreased recently?
Patient: No, it's still just as intense as before.
Doctor: Alright, thanks for the update. And how has the knee pain been affecting your mobility lately?
Patient: Well, it's still been pretty hard to move around normally because of the pain and swelling.
Doctor: I see. Has the location of your knee pain changed at all?
Patient: No, it's still in the same spot as before.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, doctor. The joint pain in my left knee is the only symptom I've been experiencing.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's start with ordering an autoimmune panel for further workup. Additionally, I will prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily to help with the pain and refer you to physical therapy.
Patient: Okay, that sounds good.
Doctor: Moving on to your hypertension, I see that your blood pressure is slightly elevated today but has been well-controlled on Norvasc 5 mg daily based on home monitoring. We'll continue your current regimen and monitoring, and order a lipid profile. Can you send me a report in the next couple of weeks?
Patient: Yes, I can do that.
Doctor: And finally, how has your diabetes type II been? Your hemoglobin a1C is slightly elevated, but your blood glucose levels have been controlled. Let's continue with metformin 500 mg twice a day.
Patient: Alright, I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor.
Doctor: Of course, it's important that we work together to manage your medical conditions. Do you have any questions or concerns?
Patient: No, I think I understand everything. Thank you.
"
"Doctor: Can you recall when your last annual exam was? 
Patient: I don't remember, sorry.
Doctor: Any other symptons?

Doctor: Let's start with your medical history. You have a history of high blood pressure and depression. How have you been managing these conditions lately?

Patient: It's been a little all over the place lately because I've been working more hours.
Doctor: Have you experienced any headaches or numbness/tingling sensations?
Patient: Yes, I've had some headaches but I think it's related to increased screen time. And my right carpal tunnel release has been doing well, no numbness or tingling in my hands or fingers.

Patient: No, nothing else. Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. I'm doing okay. Thanks for asking.
Doctor: I wanted to talk to you about your blood pressure issues. Have you noticed any changes in it lately?
Patient: Yeah, my blood pressure has been high for a while now.
Doctor: Hmm, that's concerning. Do you think there could be any correlation between your headaches and cardiovascular issues or psychiatric medication?
Patient: No, I don't think so. My headaches only happen sometimes, and they're not really related to those things.
Doctor: Okay, good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or symptoms of depression lately?
Patient: Not really.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. I'm feeling good, thanks for asking.
Doctor: Let's start by talking about your physical health. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs lately?

Doctor: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms since your blood pressure became elevated?
Patient: I think it's been a few weeks now.
Doctor: Okay, it's important to monitor your blood pressure regularly. Have you been checking it at home since you noticed it was high?
Patient: No, I haven't been checking it at home. I just noticed it was high when I came in for this appointment.
Doctor: Alright, we'll need to keep an eye on it then.
Patient: Not really, I've been eating the same things and haven't been exercising any differently.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I haven't experienced any other symptoms. I've been doing well and following my treatment plan as usual.
Doctor: How has your hypertension been since starting lisinopril?
Patient: My blood pressures have been fluctuating lately.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your blood pressure readings or side effects from the medication?
Patient: I've been taking it as prescribed, but I admit that I've had some dietary indiscretion due to my increased workload.
Doctor: Okay, we'll increase your lisinopril dosage to 10 mg once daily. Make sure to continue monitoring your blood pressure at home and follow up with me in a month.
Patient: Alright, I understand.
Doctor: Lastly, how has your carpal tunnel release been doing? It's been two years since the surgery, right?
Patient: Yes, I'm happy to say that I'm asymptomatic at this time. But I'll definitely contact you if my symptoms return.
Doctor: Sounds good. So just to recap, you're continuing your current depression treatment regimen, increasing your lisinopril dosage for hypertension management, and monitoring your blood pressure at home. Do you agree with this plan?
Patient: Yes, I understand and agree with the recommended medical treatment plan.

Doctor: That's great to hear. 
Patient: Allergy season? 
Doctor: Is there anything specific I should be doing to prepare for it?
Doctor: Sure thing! 
Patient: No, I haven't done anything yet. What do you suggest I do?
Doctor: Well, there are a few things you can try. You might want to talk to an allergist or take an over-the-counter antihistamine when symptoms start to appear. It's also helpful to keep your home clean and free of dust and other allergens.
Patient: Okay, thanks for the advice. I'll definitely look into those options.
Doctor: I noticed in your notes that you're interested in joining the army. Quitting smoking and vaping will greatly increase your chances of being accepted.
Patient: Okay, I'll keep working on cutting back and eventually quitting altogether.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. But I do use the Wixela Inhub twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.
Doctor: Okay, got it. And how about Alvesco?
Patient: I also use Alvesco twice a day, two puffs each time.
Doctor: Great, thanks for letting me know. Do you use any other inhalers or medications for your breathing?
Patient: Yes, I have Proair HFA and EpiPen as needed.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:Yes, I can't eat peanuts.
Doctor: That's right, it's really important that you avoid them completely. Have you had any allergic reactions to peanuts while taking Montelukast sodium?
Patient: No, not yet.
Doctor: Okay, good to know. It's also important to let your family, friends, and teachers know about your peanut allergy so they can help if needed.
Patient: Sure thing.
Doctor: Have you ever experienced any symptoms like swelling, difficulty breathing, or hives after eating peanuts?
Patient: Yes, I have. It's really scary.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It's really important to avoid peanuts completely to prevent further reactions. Have you ever had a seizure as a result of your severe anaphylactic reaction to peanuts?
Patient: No, thankfully not.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Not too often, just occasionally when I exercise or come into contact with triggers like dust or pollen.""

Doctor: Have you had any skin tests done to check for peanut allergy?

Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. I'm feeling good, thanks for asking.

Patient: No, I've never had a reaction like that before.
Doctor: Have you ever been diagnosed with a peanut allergy, or had any allergic reactions to peanuts in the past? 
Patient: I don't think so. Why do you ask?
Doctor: Have you had any allergies before?
Patient: Not that I'm aware of.
Doctor: Have you experienced any complications related to your moderate persistent asthma or allergic rhinitis?
Patient: Not really, just the usual symptoms like coughing and a stuffy nose.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you ever presented with anaphylactic reactions in addition to your asthma and rhinitis? 
Patient: No, I haven't had any reactions like that. Why do you ask?
Doctor: It's important to monitor your condition and be aware of any potential risks. 
Patient: I use my inhaler whenever I feel short of breath or wheezing, but sometimes I still have symptoms.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, that's pretty much it. I just really need to work on my fitness so I can meet the military requirements without relying on my inhaler.
Doctor: According to current asthma treatment guidelines, it's recommended to only use your inhaler when needed during periods of illness. So we can try reducing your medicine to Alvesco, which is a single medication, versus the two medications in Wixela. How does that sound to you?
Patient: That sounds good to me. I'll continue to use my albuterol inhaler as needed.
Doctor: Great! Your ACT score is 21 today, which is good news, and your spirometry test was better than it was in 2019. Keep up the good work!
Patient: Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: How often have you been experiencing symptoms of allergic rhinitis? And have you had any anaphylactic reactions due to peanuts?
Patient: My nose gets stuffy almost every day and I sneeze sometimes, but I've been taking Zyrtec three times a week. And no, I've successfully avoided peanuts and haven't had any anaphylactic reactions.
Doctor: That's great to hear. I'll refill your EpiPen for safety purposes. Let's also continue with your current methods to avoid exposure to peanuts.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Lastly, have you had any uncomplicated illnesses or changes in your asthma symptoms since our last visit?
Patient: No, everything has been pretty steady.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""It's been alright, I still cough sometimes though.""
Doctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on that. Have you been taking the Alvesco as prescribed, two puffs twice daily?
Patient: Yes, I have.
Doctor: That's good to hear. And have you needed to use your albuterol inhaler at all?
Patient: Only a few times.
Doctor: We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in four months to repeat the testing. Have you had any reactions recently to peanuts?
Patient: No, I've been avoiding peanuts like you said.
Doctor: Excellent. Let's make sure to continue strict avoidance of peanuts and I'll refill your EpiPen today. Finally, how has your allergic rhinitis been? Are you still taking Zyrtec as needed?
Patient: Yes, it's been helping a lot.

"Doctor: Hi there, how have you been feeling lately? I see from your medical history that you've been experiencing high blood pressure and palpitations. Can you tell me more about the symptoms you've been having? 
Patient: Sure, sometimes my heart beats really fast and hard, and I have palpitations too. 
Doctor: How often do these symptoms occur? 
Patient: Almost every day, especially when I'm active or exercising.
Doctor: Hey there, how are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm doing okay, thanks for asking.
Doctor: So, tell me about the medication you're taking for your hypertension and palpitations. 
Patient: My new doctor put me on Benicar HCT about a month ago.
Doctor: Alright, can you recall what your blood pressure readings were during your last primary care visit? 
Patient: I don't remember the exact numbers, but my doctor did say that it was high.
Doctor: Have you ever had to seek emergency care for your hypertension or palpitations before? 
Patient: No, I haven't had any episodes that required emergency care.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you ever experienced a panic attack related to your high blood pressure? 
Patient: No, I haven't had a panic attack related to my high blood pressure.
Doctor: Okay, how often have you been monitoring your systolic blood pressure since starting on Benicar HCT?
Patient: I've been checking it every day, but I'm not really sure what the numbers mean.
Doctor: Got it. Have you had any recent cardiac tests or reports? 
Patient: Yeah, I had a stress test about six months ago, but nothing since then.
Doctor: Have you received any reports from that stress test on the treadmill? 
Patient: No, I haven't received any reports from that test.
Doctor: How about any recent appointments with your current doctor regarding your high blood pressure? 
Patient: No, I haven't gotten any reports from my recent appointments with my current doctor.
Doctor: Any other symptons?

Patient: Not really, but sometimes I get headaches or feel a bit dizzy.
Doctor: Okay. Since starting on Benicar HCT, have you noticed any changes in your blood pressure readings?
Patient: I'm not sure what you mean by that, but I haven't really noticed anything different.
Doctor: Any other symptons?

Doctor: Ah, I see. Have you had your blood pressure checked recently?
Patient: Yes, my last reading was a little high.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: That's great to hear! During your physical examination, everything seemed normal. Have you been experiencing any symptoms lately? 
Patient: No, I haven't noticed anything unusual. 
Doctor: Alright, good to know. Are you currently taking any medications for your cardiovascular health? 
Patient: Oh, I don't think so. 
Doctor: Okay, no worries. Has there been any change in your cardiovascular health since we last spoke? 
Patient: No, nothing that I've noticed. 
Doctor: Have you experienced any tenderness or edema in your cardiovascular system? 
Patient: I'm not sure what those terms mean, but I haven't had any pain or swelling. 
Doctor: Got it. How has your cardiovascular health been since our last visit? 
Patient: My heart has been feeling okay. 
Doctor: Have you been taking your Benicar HCT and Amlodipine as prescribed? 
Patient: Oh, I didn't realize those were my medications. Yes, I have been taking them daily. 
Doctor: That's good to hear. How are your cardiovascular rhythms and normal heart sounds? 
Patient: They seem normal to me. 
Doctor: And how are your breath sounds? Are they normal too? 
Patient: Yes, I haven't noticed anything unusual with my breathing. 
Doctor: Great. How about your pulse and heart sounds? Are they still normal? 
Patient: Yes, they feel normal to me. 
Doctor: Any changes in your cardiovascular rhythms or breath sounds since our last visit? 
Patient: Nope, everything seems to be the same. 
Doctor: How are your cardiovascular rhythms and breath sounds today? Still normal? 
Patient: Yes, they're still normal. 
Doctor: Okay, good to know. Are your cardiovascular rhythms and breath sounds still normal? 
Patient: Yes, they're still normal. 
Doctor: And how are your cardiovascular rhythms and breath sounds today? Still normal there? 
Patient: Yes, everything seems to be the same. 
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: So, I see that we have your latest Thyroid profile from March 1st. Can you remind me, were your thyroid levels abnormal the last time we checked? 
Patient: Yeah, you said my TSH was 0. 
Doctor: Ah, I see. Have you been taking any medication for your thyroid? And what about your symptoms, have you noticed any changes since we last checked? 
Patient: No, I haven't been taking any medication for my thyroid. And I don't think I've had any symptoms related to it either. 
Doctor: Your TSH levels are still abnormal, so we may need to consider starting medication to help regulate them. We'll go over the specific medication and your symptoms once we get the results from your most recent labs. Does that make sense?
Patient: Yes, I understand.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Yeah, doc. My blood pressure has been really high lately and I feel like it's always high.""
Doctor: Can you tell me more about how high your systolic blood pressure has been presenting?
Patient: It's usually between 146-155.
Doctor: Have you been feeling any symptoms like headaches or dizziness?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes I get headaches and feel dizzy when my blood pressure is high.
Doctor: How have your medications been working for your resistant hypertension?
Patient: I'm not sure if they're working as well as they used to. Sometimes I forget to take them at the right time.
Doctor: How frequently does your resistant hypertension present itself?
Patient: It happens almost every day.
Doctor: Have you noticed any patterns or triggers for when it's worse?
Patient: Maybe when I'm stressed out or after I eat certain foods.
Doctor: Have you been monitoring your blood pressure at home? If so, what have you noticed about your readings?
Patient: No, I haven't been monitoring it at home.
Doctor: Have you made any changes to your diet or exercise routine recently that may be affecting your resistant hypertension?
Patient: No, I haven't made any changes. I know I need to exercise more and eat healthier though.
Doctor: Have you tried any lifestyle changes to help control your resistant hypertension?
Patient: I haven't really been doing anything else besides taking my medication.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your blood pressure since starting medication for resistant hypertension?
Patient: At first, it helped lower my blood pressure a bit. But lately, I feel like it's not doing enough to control it.
Doctor: How often do you typically experience resistant hypertension symptoms despite taking your medication as prescribed?
Patient: I feel like it's happening almost every day, even though I'm taking my medication at the maximal doses for 3 medications.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. I'm feeling good, thanks for asking.
Doctor: So, we've added spironolactone to your medication list.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Have you been checking your potassium levels regularly since then?
Patient: No, I don't really know what that means. Can you explain it to me?
Doctor: Sure thing. 
Doctor: We'll schedule a basic metabolic panel in two weeks to check on your potassium levels and blood pressure due to spironolactone's effect.
Patient: What's a DASH diet? And how much walking do I need to do?
Doctor: A DASH diet is basically just eating healthier by reducing salt intake and increasing potassium intake. Your maximum daily salt intake should be between 1500 and 2000 mg. As for walking, try to aim for at least 30 minutes most days of the week. 
Patient: Not that I know of, but what does electrolyte disturbances mean?
Doctor: Basically, it's just a fancy term for changes in your body's chemistry that can happen when you're taking certain medications. Spironolactone, in particular, can increase your risk of dehydration and affect your potassium levels. That's why we need to monitor those things closely.
Patient: Okay, got it. What's carvedilol?
Doctor: Carvedilol is another medication we might consider adding if we aren't able to improve your blood pressure with spironolactone alone. However, it does come with some potential side effects like erectile dysfunction, so I wanted to discuss that with you first.
Patient: I'm not sure, but what does that involve?
Doctor: We just want to make sure your heart is functioning properly and isn't being affected by the medications. We'll check on that during your next follow-up appointment.
Patient: Alright, thanks for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. I'm doing pretty well, thanks for asking.

Doctor: Okay, Edwards. Have you noticed any increase in IBS symptoms during times of stress or changes in habits?
Patient: Yeah, actually. Whenever I get really stressed out or change my routine, my stomach starts acting up.

Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Yeah, I've been taking the Elavil medication you gave me for my tummy troubles and it seems to be helping.""

Doctor: Have you experienced any headaches or pain since your last hospitalization?
Patient: I do get headaches sometimes, but it's not constant.
Doctor: That's good to hear. How has your balance been since the spinal catheter placement?
Patient: It's been a little better, but I still feel unsteady sometimes.
Doctor: Can you describe the configuration of your ventriculoperitoneal shunt?
Patient: I don't really understand what that means, can you explain it to me?
Doctor: Sure, no problem. When did you first notice cognitive impairment?
Patient: It started around May of last year.
Doctor: Has your cognitive function improved or gotten worse since then?
Patient: Unfortunately, it's been getting worse. I have trouble remembering things and get confused more often now.
Doctor: How many hospitalizations have you had for your condition?
Patient: I've been in the hospital a few times, but I can't remember exactly how many.
Doctor: And how many visits have you had with us regarding this issue?

Doctor: Speaking of mobility, have you noticed any improvements in your gait impairment since your last visit? 
Patient: Sorry, but I don't have any gait impairment or had a shunt surgery.
Doctor: Oh, I apologize for the confusion. Have you noticed any changes in your urinary incontinence since your hydrocephalus diagnosis?
Patient: I'm not sure what hydrocephalus means, but my urinary incontinence has been getting worse.
Doctor: Okay, let's move on to cognitive impairment. Have you noticed any difficulties with your thinking or memory related to your urinary incontinence or other health issues?
Patient: No, I don't think my urinary incontinence is related to any cognitive problems.
Doctor: Good to know. Have you noticed any improvements in your cognitive function since your last visit?
Patient: I don't have any cognitive impairment, so there haven't been any improvements or changes.
Doctor: Understood. Have you noticed any changes in your urinary incontinence since your last visit?
Patient: Yes, it's been getting worse and I'm having more trouble controlling my bladder.
Doctor: That's concerning. Has your urinary incontinence been affecting your sleep quality?
Patient: Yes, I have to wake up multiple times in the night because of it.
Doctor: Have you made any changes to your diet or fluid intake to see if it helps with your urinary incontinence?
Patient: No, I haven't tried that yet.
Doctor: Okay. Have you started any medication or treatment for your urinary incontinence?
Patient: Not yet, but I hope to find a solution soon.
Doctor: There are various treatments we can explore such as pelvic floor exercises, physical therapy, bladder training, and behavioral therapy. Would you be willing to try any of these options?
Patient: Yes, I'm willing to try whatever might help me with my urinary incontinence.
Doctor: Hi there! How are you feeling today? 
Patient: Not so good, to be honest. 
Doctor: I see, well let's go over a few things. Have you been having any trouble with your daily activities? 
Patient: Yeah, it's been hard for me to do things like exercise or wear certain clothes because of the rash. 
Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any negative impact on your overall well-being due to the rash? 
Patient: Yeah, I feel pretty miserable because of the rash. It's hard to enjoy anything when you're so uncomfortable. 
Doctor: I understand. Have you noticed any difficulty carrying out your daily functions lately? 
Patient: Yes, unfortunately. It's been harder for me to do things than usual. 
Doctor: That's not good. Have you experienced any fever or unintentional weight loss? 
Patient: No, nothing like that. 
Doctor: Alright, let's move on to your genitourinary symptoms. Have you been experiencing any painful urination or decreased output? 
Patient: No, but I have been dealing with urinary incontinence and have to wear a diaper. 
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any negative impact on your ability to carry objects due to your urinary incontinence or any leakage?

Doctor: Hi there, Mr. Watson! How are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm feeling pretty good.
Doctor: Great to hear. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any issues with your head or face recently?
Patient: No, everything seems fine with the shunt site. It's clean, dry, and intact, and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.
Doctor: That's good news. Let's move on to your neurological status. 
Patient: I think it's been okay.
Doctor: How has your memory been lately? 
Patient: I scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. I was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice, which is a slight improvement over my initial score.
Doctor: That's great progress. Have you noticed any changes in your gait and balance since the last time we checked?
Patient: My walking without an assistive device has improved slightly since last time.
Doctor: That's encouraging. Let's move on to your cranial nerves. Have you experienced any issues with dysarthria or abnormal extraocular movements?
Patient: No, my pupils are equal and extraocular movements are intact. My face is also symmetric.
Doctor: Good to know. How about your motor function and coordination?
Patient: Everything seems normal for bulk and strength, but finger-to-nose coordination is slow.
Doctor: Okay, noted. Is there anything else you'd like to mention or any concerns you have?
Patient: No, I think that covers everything.
Doctor: Alright then, keep up the good work and we'll see you at your next appointment.
Doctor: Hi there! How are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm doing alright, thanks for asking.
Doctor: I noticed in your medical records that you had a CT scan of the head on 10/15/2020. Can you tell me about the results of that scan?
Patient: Oh yeah, they found a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a flat 3rd ventricular contour and a span of 10 mm. There was also a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with a small subdural collection. The radiologist didn't see any extra axial fluid collections. And there was some small vessel ischemic change as well.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Regarding the CT scan, did it show any abnormalities in terms of extra fluid or anything like that?
Patient: No, the scan came back normal. Nothing abnormal was found in my fluid balance.
Doctor: That's good to hear. I noticed in your medical history that you have had a history of ischemic strokes. Have you experienced any symptoms related to that recently?
Patient: No, I haven't had any problems with that lately.
Doctor: How long has it been since your last ischemic episode?
Patient: It's been a few years now.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your fluid intake or output lately? Are there any concerns with the amount of fluids you are drinking or urinating?
Patient: I don't think so. I've been drinking water like usual and haven't had any concerns.
Doctor: Have you been experiencing any issues with your fluid balance lately?
Patient: No, everything feels normal to me. I haven't noticed any concerns with my fluid balance.
Doctor: Have you noticed any pain, discomfort, swelling, or abnormal fluid retention on the right side of your body?
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any of those symptoms.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Lastly, can you update me on the condition of your shunt site? Have you noticed any redness, swelling, or discharge?
Patient: No, everything looks the same to me. There hasn't been any changes in my shunt site.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Not too great, I've been having trouble with my walking and going to the bathroom a lot.""
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement in your gait or urinary incontinence since your surgery?
Patient: Not really, it's still difficult for me to walk and I still have to go to the bathroom frequently.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your overall health or symptoms besides these issues?
Patient: No, not really. Although, sometimes I forget things.
Doctor: That sounds like cognitive impairment. Have you noticed any improvement in that area since starting physical therapy or medication?
Patient: No, my memory is still pretty bad even though I've been taking medications and going to physical therapy.
Doctor: Okay, let's focus on your hydrocephalus. Since your shunt surgery, have you experienced any symptomatic episodes related to your hydrocephalus like headaches?
Patient: No, I haven't had any headaches or other symptoms that I know of.
Doctor: Good to hear. There is a small amount of fluid collection in the right parietal region, but I don't believe this is causing any symptoms.
Patient: That's good to know.
Doctor: Unfortunately, based on your medical history and symptoms, it's unlikely that you'll be able to regain enough speed in your gait to pass a driver's safety evaluation.
Patient: I was hoping I could drive again soon.
Doctor: I understand, and we can certainly schedule an evaluation if you'd like, but I think it's exceeding unlikely that you're capable of passing the test at this time.
Patient: That's disappointing.
Doctor: Yes, I'm sorry. However, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. So, it's possible that you may improve enough in the future to pass a driver's safety evaluation.
Patient: I'll keep that in mind.
Doctor: Great. In the meantime, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or constipation since your surgery?
Patient: No, everything seems normal in that area.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. I'm feeling much better, thank you.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Let's discuss your hydrocephalus. Based on your clinical notes, it seems like you have been making some improvement with the fluid collection.
Patient: Yes, I think so too.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changing symptoms since your shunt was placed?
Patient: No, not really. Everything has been pretty stable.
Doctor: Good to know. I would like to keep the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt. How does that sound to you?
Patient: That sounds fine to me.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: Just to clarify, are you asking if there might be any issues related to your hydrocephalus or shunt during the follow-up appointment?
Patient: Yes, I am concerned about hydrocephalus, improvement, shunt, and the follow-up appointment.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms or had any problems with your shunt since your last visit?
Patient: Nope, everything seems good.
Doctor: How has your overall health been since your last visit?
Patient: It's been okay. I've been taking my medications as prescribed, so nothing major to report on my overall health.
Doctor: Have you been able to keep up with taking your medications regularly?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking them regularly. Hydrocephalus, improvement, changing symptoms, shunt aren't a concern right now.
Doctor: Have you experienced any side effects or issues with any of your medications?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any side effects at all. 
Doctor: Have you noticed any other changes or symptoms that concern you?
Patient: No, nothing else has been bothering me lately."

Patient: I'm not sure what that means, sorry.
Doctor: That's okay. How often do you consume alcohol?
Patient: I admit to drinking 4-5 beers a week.
Doctor: I understand that you're interested in Naltrexone injections. However, it's important to note that stopping alcohol consumption would likely improve your blood pressure.
Patient: I know, but it's hard to stop completely.
Doctor: I understand. How often do you experience hypertension symptoms throughout the day?
Patient: It varies, sometimes it's worse in the morning and sometimes at night. But it's pretty constant throughout the day.
Doctor: And how has your blood pressure been since starting the medication?
Patient: It's still high, even though I've been taking it as directed.
Doctor: Have you checked your blood pressure at different times of the day?
Patient: Yes, I check it in the morning and evening. It's usually higher at night but improves after sitting for a few minutes.
Doctor: Okay, let's keep an eye on that. Is there anything else you'd like to mention before we wrap up?
Patient: No, I think that covers everything.
Doctor: Alright then, we'll continue to monitor your blood pressure and discuss any necessary changes at our next appointment.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about your alcohol use disorder?
Patient: Yeah, sure.
Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your medical conditions since increasing your alcohol use?
Patient: Hmm, not really sure.
Doctor: Alright. Have you had any previous medical conditions related to your hypertension or hypercholesterolemia?
Patient: Not that I know of.

Doctor: How is your breathing? Any cough or shortness of breath? 
Patient: No, my breathing is normal and I don't have a cough. 
Doctor: Great. Let me listen to your chest. It's clear to percussion and auscultation. You're breathing normally. 
Patient: That's good to hear. 
Doctor: Do you feel any tenderness in your CVA? 
Patient: No, I don't feel any tenderness. 
Doctor: Your cardiac rhythm is regular and there's no murmur or gallop. 
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: Do you notice any ankle edema or swelling? 
Patient: No, I don't think so. 
Doctor: I see that your skin is moist. Is there anything unusual you've noticed about it? 
Patient: No, my skin feels normal.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Yeah, I've been having a hard time cutting back on something.""
Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. How about your prescribed medications? Have you been taking your hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 and lisinopril 20mg for your hypertension?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking them as prescribed.
Doctor: Great! Have you noticed any changes in your blood pressure or cholesterol levels since your last visit?
Patient: I'm not really sure. I haven't been keeping track of it, to be honest.
Doctor: No problem, we can check that today. How often do you drink alcohol now?
Patient: I used to drink a lot, but I'm trying to cut back now. Maybe once or twice a week, but not as much as before.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Doctor: Can you tell me if you have experienced any other symptoms besides the ones we have discussed?Patient: Yeah, I remember talking about that. Sure, let's give it a try. When do I start?
Doctor: You'll start the injectable form of naltrexone on May 17. We reviewed the potential risks and side effects, so if you experience anything unusual, please let me know.
Patient: Okay, got it. 
Doctor: Also, have you received your flu shot this year?
Patient: Yes, I did get my flu shot.
Doctor: What about Shingrix?
Patient: What's Shingrix?
Doctor: Shingrix is recommended for people over 50 years old. Would you be willing to upgrade your influenza vaccination and consider getting Shingrix too?
Patient: Yeah, I'll definitely consider it.
Doctor: Great! Now, let's talk about your blood pressure.
Patient: Not really, but I'm trying to cut back on alcohol like we discussed.
Doctor: That's good to hear because cutting back on alcohol may improve your hypertension and overall health. Do you think you're able to completely stop consuming alcohol?
Patient: I'll try my best.
Divided:
Doctor: It's likely that if you're able to cut back or quit drinking altogether, your blood pressure will improve significantly. Our target is to keep it between 130-140/70-80. I'll see you back the week of June 14 for your second naltrexone injection. 
Patient: Would you prefer to continue with the injectable form or switch to pills?
Doctor: Okay, and speaking of that, do you think the injectable form may be easier to remember? 
Patient: I agree, I think the injectable form may be easier to remember.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: No problem at all. Also, have you been keeping track of your blood pressure and alcohol consumption? Let me know if you notice anything out of the ordinary.
Patient: My blood pressure has been okay and I haven't had any alcohol lately. But I'll definitely keep an eye on it.
Doctor: Sounds good. And if you experience any side effects from your medication, please give us a call.
Patient: Will do. Thanks again, doc. See you soon.

"Doctor: Hi there! What brought you in today for full-spectrum sexually transmitted disease testing? 
Patient: I just wanted to make sure everything is alright down there. Better safe than sorry, right? 
Doctor: Absolutely! Can you tell me about your recent sexual activity? Have you engaged in any unprotected sex or high-risk behaviors that could have put you at risk for transmitting or contracting a disease? 
Patient: No, I always use protection. But I still want to be proactive about my sexual health. 
Doctor: That's great to hear that you are being responsible with protection. Do you have any specific concerns or symptoms that led you to seek testing? 
Patient: No, I feel fine. I just want to make sure everything is okay. 
Doctor: Okay, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you are primarily concerned about your sexual health and want to be proactive. I recommend full-spectrum sexually transmitted disease testing to ensure that everything is okay down there. It's always important to stay on top of your sexual health. 
Patient: Sounds good to me. Thank you, doctor!
Doctor: Hi there, Ms. Ross! Can you tell me more about the change in discharge and odor you noticed?
Patient: Yeah, I noticed it last week. 
Doctor: When did it start?
Patient: The color, consistency, and odor of my vaginal discharge were different than usual. The right side of my vagina is also starting to become painful.
Doctor: Have you had any recent Pap smears?
Patient: No, I haven't had one in a while.
Doctor: Have you ever had an abnormal Pap Smear?
Patient: Yes, I had one around the age of 20, but all my Pap Smears since then, including my most recent one approximately 6 months ago, have all been normal.
Doctor: Have you engaged in any high-risk sexual behaviors recently?
Patient: No, I haven't. However, I recently learned that my partner of 3 years has been engaging in sexual encounters with other people for quite some time, so I want to be evaluated for all sexually transmitted diseases.
Doctor: Have you noticed any other abnormal vaginal discharge recently?
Patient: Yes, the color and consistency were different than usual, which alarmed me. But I didn't pay attention until the pain and soreness on the right side of my vagina started.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: So during your pelvic exam earlier, did you experience any pain or discomfort other than the soreness you mentioned before?
Patient: No, I didn't feel anything out of the ordinary during the exam.
Doctor: Alright. Did we find any lesions or masses on your cervix during the exam? And have you noticed any unusual discharge or bleeding recently?
Patient: Nope, everything looked normal down there and I haven't had any strange discharge or bleeding.
Doctor: Did the swabs we took during the exam show any signs of a sexually transmitted disease or any other infections?
Patient: I don't think so, but I'll let you know if anything comes up.
Doctor: Lastly, did we notice any abnormalities in the color or texture of your cervix during the exam? And have you experienced any pain during sex or abnormal bleeding between periods?
Patient: Sorry, I can't recall if there were any issues with my cervix or if I've had any pain or bleeding. 
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: So, looking at your medical history, it seems like we haven't done a screening for sexually transmitted diseases yet. Would you be interested in getting tested?
Patient: Yeah, sure. Better safe than sorry, right?
Doctor: Have you had any recent sexual activity that could have put you at risk for acquiring a sexually transmitted disease?
Patient: Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. But I have been sexually active recently.
Doctor: When was your last sexual encounter, if you don't mind me asking?
Patient: About a month ago, I think.
Doctor: Have you noticed any symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease since then?
Patient: No, nothing out of the ordinary.
Doctor: Have you ever been screened for sexually transmitted diseases before?
Patient: Nope, this will be my first time.
Doctor: Have you had any recent unprotected sexual encounters?
Patient: Yes, unfortunately.
Doctor: And have you had any sexual partners since our last appointment?
Patient: Yep, a few different ones.
Doctor: Alright, just to double-check, have you had any recent sexual activity that may have put you at risk for a sexually transmitted disease?
Patient: Well, I'm not positive, but I think it's better to err on the side of caution and get tested anyways.
Doctor: That's definitely a good mindset to have. Have you ever tested positive for a sexually transmitted disease in the past?
Patient: No, never.
Doctor: Okay, just one more question - have you considered getting screened for sexually transmitted diseases before?
Patient: I've thought about it, but never really went through with it until now.
Doctor: Alright, well let's go ahead and schedule that test for you then. It's always important to prioritize your sexual health.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Are there any new symptoms or changes in your sexual behavior that you've noticed since our last visit?
Patient: No, everything seems pretty much the same.
Doctor: Okay. Based on your sexual history, we do consider you at high risk for contracting an STD.
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: Therefore, we will screen you today for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C. Is that okay with you?
Patient: Yes, I don't mind getting tested just to be safe."
"Doctor: Hi there, how are you feeling today?

Patient: It feels heavy with the swelling, and I haven't noticed any changes. The skin still feels warm to the touch but I don't think it's red. 
Doctor: Got it. How has the swelling been recently? Any improvement or worsening? Are you experiencing any pain in the area? 
Patient: It's been the same and I haven't experienced any pain. 
Doctor: I see. And how about now? Has the swelling improved or gotten worse? Are you still feeling warmth in the skin? Any pain? 
Patient: It's still there but hasn't changed much. The skin is still warm to the touch but no pain at all. 
Doctor: Thanks for letting me know. How has the swelling been overall? Has it increased, decreased or stayed the same? Do you feel any pain in the area?

Doctor: Did the doctor mention any potential risks of ruptures during the fluid aspiration and steroid injection? 
Patient: No, they didn't say anything about that.
Doctor: Did the doctor verbally explain the steps of the fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure to you? 
Patient: Yes, they did.
Doctor: Did the doctor obtain your verbal consent before performing the fluid aspiration and steroid injection? 
Patient: Yes, they did ask me if I agreed to the procedure.
Doctor: Did the doctor provide you with any verbal instructions or precautions to follow after the fluid aspiration and steroid injection? 
Patient: Yeah, I was told to rest my knee for a few days and avoid physical activities that could be too much.
Doctor: Did the doctor explain the potential side effects of steroid injections during your verbal consent? 
Patient: They didn't specifically mention side effects, but they did explain the risks and benefits.
Doctor: Did the doctor give you any verbal instructions on what to do if you experienced any adverse reactions or complications after the fluid aspiration and steroid injection? 
Patient: No, they didn't say anything about that.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:Yes, actually my right knee has been hurting a lot and that's why I came in.
Doctor: Have you been taking any medication to manage the pain from your arthritis?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: Just so you know, some of these medications can come with side effects.
Doctor: Ah, I see. Well, there are options but it's important to be aware of the potential risks associated with certain medications. Are you familiar with those risks?
Patient: No, I had no idea. Can you tell me more about them?
Doctor: Any other symptons?

Doctor: That's great to hear. Have you tried any new treatments or remedies besides medication and therapy for your arthritis pain?
Patient: No, not really.
Doctor: Okay. And how have you been managing the swelling in your right leg?
Patient: I usually wear support hose, which helps a bit, but my whole right leg has been swollen since the last visit.
Doctor: I see. Have you discussed the possibility of a fluid aspiration procedure with your PCP to help manage the edema in your right leg?
Patient: No, I haven't talked to my PCP about it.
Doctor: How has your response been to physical therapy?
Patient: I think it's been helping, but I'm not sure.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement in the strength and flexibility of your knee?
Doctor: We will arrange for an x-ray of your right knee and refer you to physical therapy. Have you considered using support hose or compression stockings to help manage the swelling in your right leg?
Patient: Yes, I usually wear support hose.
Doctor: How often do you monitor your fluid intake and check for any changes in the swelling of your right leg?
Patient: I've been trying to monitor my fluid intake, but I haven't noticed much improvement yet.
Doctor: It might be helpful to follow a low salt diet as well. 
Patient: No, I haven't talked to them about it.
Doctor: Please make sure to bring it up with them. Have you discussed the potential risks of Xeljanz XR and Celebrex with your rheumatologist or PCP?
Patient: No, I haven't talked to them about it.
Doctor: Okay, we will check in a few weeks to see if any changes need to be made. Please note that Xeljanz is a high-risk medication and we will need to monitor your CMP levels periodically every couple of months.
Patient: Alright.

"Doctor: Hey there, how has your perioral dermatitis been since the last time you were here?
Patient: It's been okay, not too bad.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your skin since then?
Patient: Not really, it's just a little bit red and bumpy.
Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any new or different symptoms related to your perioral dermatitis?
Patient: No, nothing new or different. Just the same old stuff.
Doctor: Got it. Have you made any changes to your diet or skincare routine that could be affecting your perioral dermatitis?
Patient: No, I haven't changed anything up.
Doctor: How about your toothpaste or mouthwash? Any changes there?

Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, just the lingering issue that hasn't fully resolved, but it's under control.
Doctor: That's good to hear. How about your ocular rosacea? Is there any redness or irritation in your eyes lately?
Patient: No, it's been okay.
Doctor: Great. I see that you're using sulfacetamide wash twice a day. Has it caused any drying of the skin?
Patient: No, my skin is much improved and moisturized.
Doctor: Wonderful. And you follow up with MetroCream after using the wash?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: I understand Elidel isn't covered by your insurance. Are you experiencing any side effects from the medications you're currently taking?
Patient: No, everything seems fine so far.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
What other symptoms are you experiencing besides the cough and fatigue?Patient: Actually, yes. I have this rash around my mouth that just won't go away. It's called Perioral dermatitis.
Doctor: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried any new products or changed your skincare routine recently that may have triggered the rash around your mouth?
Patient: No, I haven't changed anything. It just appeared out of nowhere.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't think so. I was just wondering what kind of medication I need to take.
Doctor: We have Doxycycline cream, MetroCream, and Sulfacetamide wash. 
Patient: No, I haven't used any of them. What are they for?
Doctor: These medications are used to treat skin conditions like acne, rosacea, and perioral dermatitis. For your specific case, we will start with the Doxycycline cream. You should apply it twice daily.
Patient: Alright, thank you. Is there anything else I should know about these medications?
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:Oh, you mean those red bumps on my face? Yeah, I noticed them too.
Doctor: Yes, those are the ones. Can you tell me more about your skin type and any past experiences with redness or irritation?
Patient: Well, I'm not really sure what my skin type is. But I do tend to get red and irritated sometimes, especially when I use certain products.
Doctor: Okay, thanks for letting me know.
Patient: No, I haven't. What does that mean?
Doctor: It's just a way to categorize different skin types based on how easily they tan, their sensitivity to the sun, and their tendency to develop freckles or other pigmentation.
Patient: Ah, I see. Is there anything I should be doing to take care of my skin better?
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""I actually have some other symptoms.""
Doctor: That's not good to hear. How have your perioral dermatitis symptoms been since our last visit? Have they improved or gotten worse?
Patient: I think they've gotten better, but my face still gets really red sometimes.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement in your perioral dermatitis or rosacea symptoms?
Patient: I haven't started taking the new medication yet, but I hope it helps.
Doctor: Got it. And how about your current medication? Have you seen any improvement in your perioral dermatitis or rosacea symptoms since starting it?

Patient: Well, my left eye has been bothering me a bit.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you noticed any resolution or improvement in your perioral dermatitis and rosacea symptoms since our last visit?

Doctor: Alright. Have you noticed any decreased severity in your perioral dermatitis and rosacea symptoms?
Patient: No, they're still pretty bad.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I haven't experienced any other symptoms. The doxycycline seems to be working well and the redness and bumps on my face are improving.
Divided:
Doctor: That's great to hear! I want you to continue using the doxycycline twice daily until you reach full resolution. Then, you can reduce application to once a day for an additional week.
Patient: Okay, sounds good.
Doctor: We won't be using Elidel since it's too expensive without insurance. Instead, I'll provide a prescription for Tacrolimus and we'll discuss possible side effects of the medication.
Divided:
Doctor: Additionally, continue using the Sulfacetamide face wash once a day and use the Bruder mask as needed. 
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Now, let's talk about your rosacea. You can keep using MetroCream twice daily and I recommend gently washing your eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser. You can also try using a gentle cream like Vanicream.
Patient: Alright, thank you so much for your help!
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I haven't noticed any changes or worsening of my symptoms so far."

Patient: Hello, Doctor. I've been experiencing abdominal pain.
Doctor: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe the nature and location of your abdominal pain?
Patient: My stomach hurts. It feels like a sharp pain in my belly button area.
Doctor: I see. And how long have you been experiencing abdominal pain?
Patient: I've been feeling this pain for a few days now.
Doctor: Okay, and on a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is your abdominal pain?
Patient: It's about a 7 or 8. It hurts a lot and makes it hard for me to do anything.
Doctor: I understand. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements recently?

Patient: It's probably around a 6 or 7. 
Doctor: Alright. We'll need to investigate further into this issue. Do you have any questions or concerns about this? 
Patient: No, not really. I just want to figure out what's going on. 
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: Any other symptons?

Doctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it and monitor it closely. Let's also check your temperature. Are you experiencing any fevers or chills?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any fever or chills.
Doctor: That's good. Your body temperature is afebrile. Lastly, let's check your oxygen saturation. You're currently breathing room air. Is that okay for you?
Patient: Yes, I'm comfortable breathing room air.
Doctor: Alright. Your oxygen saturation is at 99%. Everything looks good so far.
Doctor: Alright, let's move on to the physical exam. I listened to your lungs and they sound clear. Have you had any trouble breathing or coughing lately?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed anything like that.
Doctor: During palpation of your abdomen, did you feel any pain or discomfort?
Patient: It felt okay to me, but I'm not sure what you were checking for.
Doctor: That's alright. Did you notice any unusual sounds when I listened to your heart during the exam?
Patient: No, it sounded normal to me. Is my heart okay?
Divided:
Doctor: Yes, everything is good with your heart for now. Lastly, when I pressed on your abdomen, did you experience any pain or discomfort?
Patient: No.
Doctor: I did detect some slight guarding in your right upper quadrant, but no rebound tenderness. And your bowel sounds are completely normal.
Doctor: Hi there! I see that you had an abdominal ultrasound done recently. How did it go?
Patient: Oh, it went fine.
Doctor: Great. The report shows that you have multiple gallstones in your gallbladder and some mild thickening. Did they find anything else abnormal during the ultrasound? 
Patient: No, just the gallstones and mild thickening. 
Doctor: Okay, good to know. Did you experience any discomfort or pain during the ultrasound? 
Patient: No, I didn't feel anything like that. 
Doctor: That's good to hear. Can you remember when exactly you had the ultrasound done? 
Patient: It was last week, but I'm not entirely sure of the date. 
Doctor: Got it. And how did you prepare for the ultrasound? 
Patient: The doctor told me not to eat or drink anything for a few hours before the test. 
Doctor: Perfect. Why did your doctor order the ultrasound in the first place? 
Patient: To check if there were any issues in my abdomen. 
Doctor: Understood. Just to clarify, besides the gallstones and mild thickening, did they find anything else abnormal during the ultrasound? 
Patient: No, nothing else. 
Doctor: Okay, got it. 
Patient: Last week, but I can't remember the exact day.
Doctor: No worries. And did you feel any pain or discomfort during the ultrasound? 
Patient: No, it was completely painless. 
Doctor: Great to hear that. And do you happen to know why your doctor ordered the ultrasound specifically? 
Patient: Yeah, to look for any problems in my abdomen. They found the gallstones afterwards. 
Doctor: Alright, thanks for clarifying that. When did you have the ultrasound? 
Patient: It was last week, but I don't remember the exact date.
Doctor: Okay, thanks for letting me know. And can you confirm if you felt any discomfort or pain during the ultrasound? 
Patient: No, I didn't feel anything like that. 
Doctor: Good to hear that. And just to be clear again, why did your doctor order the ultrasound in the first place? 
Patient: To check for any issues in my abdomen.

Patient: No, nothing else was found.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I haven't experienced any other symptoms.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Based on the ultrasound findings, have you experienced any symptoms of cholecystitis or gallstones?
Patient: I'm not sure what those are, but I haven't had any pain recently.
Doctor: Okay. Based on the ultrasound findings, do you have any symptomatic gallstones or obstruction in your gallbladder?
Patient: Sorry, I don't know what that means either. But I haven't had any pain in my stomach lately.
Doctor: No problem. Have you talked to your primary care provider about surgical treatment for your inflamed gallbladder or gallstones?
Patient: No, not yet.
Doctor: I believe a laparoscopic cholecystectomy would be the best course of action based on your medical history and ultrasound findings. We can schedule the surgery for next week, and I'll explain everything you need to know about preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care.
Patient: Okay, sounds good.
Doctor: Before the surgery, make sure you avoid high-fat foods and focus on eating foods that are high in fiber. And after the surgery, you should take it easy for a while and avoid hiking. But walking on solid ground is fine after one week.
Patient: Got it. Thanks for letting me know.
Doctor: How has your diet been since being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes?
Patient: Yes, I've been trying to follow the guidelines my doctor gave me.

Patient:No, not at all. My neck feels perfectly fine.

Patient: Nope, I didn't feel any tenderness at all. It didn't hurt when you palpated it.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: So, based on your clinical notes, it looks like there hasn't been any signs of injury or bruising. Is that correct?

Patient: Yes, it hurt a lot when you touched it. It was tough to handle.

Doctor: Have you tried any home remedies or over-the-counter pain medication for your shoulder pain?

Patient: No, I haven't experienced any weakness or numbness. It's just the shoulder pain and tenderness that's bothering me.
Doctor: Okay, we'll monitor your shoulder and make sure it's healing properly. Has the medication helped with the pain since you started taking it?
Patient: Yes, it has been helping me feel better.
Doctor: That's great to hear. How long have you been feeling the pain and tenderness in your shoulder?
Patient: Since the injury happened.
Doctor: Understood. Try not to use your arm too much and rest as much as possible. Have you noticed any improvement in the range of motion of your shoulder?
Patient: I haven't moved it too much, but I still feel the pain and tenderness when I do.
Doctor: That's normal. Has the pain affected your sleep at all?
Patient: Yes, it's been difficult to sleep because of the pain.

Patient: Okay, I'll do that. Thanks for your help.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't think so. I'm just really concerned about this acromioclavicular joint fracture. Can you explain what it means and what my treatment options are?
Doctor: Oh no! How did you injure your shoulder and when did the pain start? 
Patient: Honestly, I don't remember injuring it or when the pain started. It's been hurting for a while now.

Patient: It's been pretty bad.
Doctor: Is it affecting your daily activities or sleep?
Patient: Yeah, it hurts when I try to do anything with my arm.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement in your shoulder pain since you started taking the medication? 
Patient: Yeah, it's been getting better little by little. The medication is okay, but the pain still bothers me sometimes. 
Doctor: That's good to hear about your shoulder pain improving with the medication. Let's keep an eye on it and make sure it continues to improve.
Doctor: Have you made an appointment for your CT scan of your right shoulder yet?
Patient: No, I still haven't gotten around to it.
Doctor: Alright, so let's talk about what we found in your examination and x-rays. How are you feeling after wearing the sling for a few days?
Patient: It helps a little bit, but my shoulder still hurts sometimes.
Doctor: Your radiographic findings showed that you've got an acute acromioclavicular joint fracture. We're going to keep you in the sling and prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once a day to help with the pain. But we also need to get a CT scan of your right shoulder to evaluate further.
Patient: Got it."
"Doctor: Hi, Jeremy! How are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm doing alright. Just dealing with this low back pain.
Doctor: I understand. Let's start by talking about when your pain started. Can you tell me about it?

Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. It feels much better now.
Doctor: That's good to hear! Has your knee been improving since the surgery?
Patient: Yeah, it has been getting better slowly over time.
Doctor: That's great! Can you tell me in what specific ways your knee has improved over the past two years?
Patient: Well, it's not as painful anymore and I can move it easily now. Before the surgery, it used to be very stiff and painful.

Doctor: Can you describe the pain? Is it sharp or more of a dull ache? 
Patient: It's more of a dull ache, like a constant soreness in my lower back. 
Doctor: Okay, have you tried anything to alleviate the pain? Like medication or heat/ice packs? 
Patient: Yeah, I've tried using heat and ice packs on my lower back. 
Doctor: Do they seem to help at all? 
Patient: Yes, they both provide some relief. 
Doctor: Does the pain get worse with certain activities or movements? 
Patient: Yeah, it seems to exacerbate with certain movements. 
Doctor: Have you noticed any swelling or redness around the area? 
Patient: No, I haven't seen any swelling or redness. 
Doctor: Alright, have you experienced any bladder or bowel problems along with the pain? 
Patient: No, everything seems normal in that regard.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about your blood pressure and heart rate while on room air?
Patient: My blood pressure has been 117/56 mm Hg and my heart rate is around 68 BPM. But I noticed that my heart rate was a bit high sometimes.

Patient: Not really. My blood pressure has been pretty consistent but my heart rate has been consistently high.
Doctor: Any other symptons?

Doctor: Got it. Just to clarify, you haven't experienced any discomfort in your neck when it is palpated?
Patient: That's correct. No pain or discomfort at all.
Doctor: So, I noticed during your examination that you had a positive straight leg raise. That means that when we raised your leg, you experienced pain in your lower back. Did you also feel any pain when we tested the flexibility of your lower back?
Patient: Yes, I did feel some pain and it was difficult to move.
Doctor: Okay, that's what we call decreased flexion and extension. We also checked for muscle spasms or tightness in your paraspinal muscles. Did you experience any discomfort or spasms during the exam?
Patient: Yes, my back was hurting and I felt some tightness in my muscles.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Doctor's Answer:""Well, we still need to do some further tests to confirm, but it's definitely a positive sign. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any other symptoms besides the back pain?""
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, just the lower back pain.
Doctor: I see that in your medical notes it says you may have an acute disc herniation. Can you tell me more about that?

Doctor: Have you noticed any numbness or tingling sensation in your legs along with the low back pain? 
Patient: Yes, actually my left leg feels tingly sometimes and it's also been swollen.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, just the back pain.
Doctor: After reviewing your examination and radiographic findings, I think we need to have a discussion about possible next steps. Your x-rays didn't show any fractures, but I would like to get an MRI of your lumbar spine to check for a possible herniated disc.
Patient: Okay, that sounds good.
Doctor: In the meantime, how has the meloxicam been working for you? Has it helped with the pain at all?
Patient: It's been alright. I haven't noticed a huge difference yet, but maybe it takes time.

Patient: It helps a little bit, but my knee still feels loose and uncomfortable.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your pain levels or frequency over the past few days?
Patient: No, unfortunately my knee pain has been about the same since the injury.
Doctor: Have you found any activities or positions that make your pain better or worse?
Patient: No, my knee pain seems to be pretty consistent no matter what I do.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I haven't experienced any other symptoms. I've just been doing a lot of paperwork and computer work at my desk.

Patient: I usually spend about 8 to 10 hours a day sitting at my desk, sometimes more.
Doctor: Do you take any breaks or stretch during your workday to ease the strain on your knees?
Patient: I try to take quick breaks to stretch my legs or grab a snack, but not too often.

Patient: It's been harder to sit at my desk for long periods of time because my knee starts to hurt.

Patient: Yes, definitely. My knee pain gets worse when I sit for too long at my desk. It's frustrating.
Doctor: Does your knee pain impact your ability to concentrate on your work or do certain tasks?
Patient: Absolutely. It's hard for me to focus on my work when my knee is hurting, and sometimes I can't even perform certain tasks properly.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, just the pain in my right knee.
Doctor: Oh no, sorry to hear that. Have you ever had any knee injuries or surgeries before? 
Patient: No, never had any issues with my knees until now. 
Doctor: How long have you been experiencing the right knee pain? 
Patient: It's been bothering me for a few days, maybe a week. 
Doctor: Okay, good to know. Have you noticed any swelling or redness around your knee? 
Patient: Yeah, it's been a little swollen and red. 
Doctor: Hmm, have you noticed any change in the movement of your knee? 
Patient: Yeah, it's been harder to move and hurts when I try to bend it. 
Doctor: Got it. How would you rate the frequency and duration of the pain in your knee? 
Patient: It hurts pretty much all the time and it's been consistent. 
Doctor: I see. Any other symptoms you've noticed lately like fever, chills, cough or sore throat? 
Patient: No, none of those. 
Doctor: What about abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea? 
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any of those either. 
Doctor: Alright. 
Patient: My sleep has been okay, but the knee pain is definitely affecting my energy levels.
Doctor: Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or dizziness?
Patient: No.
Doctor: What about your knee pain?
Patient: It's been bothering me.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Yeah, I've been having trouble walking normally.""
Doctor: Okay, have you noticed any changes in your gait or how you walk due to the knee pain?
Patient: Yeah, my right leg kind of drags when I walk and it hurts a lot.
Doctor: I see. How long have you noticed the changes in your gait?
Patient: I think it's been a few weeks now. The pain started off as mild but it just kept getting worse.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:Yes, there was some slight discoloration and my knee hurts a lot. When you touched the inside part, it hurt even more.
Doctor: I see. Did you experience any pain or difficulty when I performed the Lachman's test on your knee? It seems like there might be some swelling and bruising on the inside of your knee.
Patient: Yes, my knee hurts really bad and I had some difficulty during the examination. 
Doctor: Okay. And did you experience any pain or difficulty during the examination of your knee, specifically during palpation?
Patient: Yes, my knee hurt a lot when you were examining it.
Doctor: I understand. Lastly, did you experience any difficulty during the Lachman's test examination of your knee?
Patient: Yes, my knee hurt a lot during that test too.
Doctor: Thank you for letting me know. How's your knee feeling today?
Patient: It still hurts quite a bit.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain? How bad is it on a scale of 1 to 10?
Patient: I'd say it's around an 8 or 9. It's really hard for me to walk or stand without feeling pain.
Doctor: Have you noticed any swelling or bruising around your knee?
Patient: Yeah, my knee is pretty swollen and there's some bruising too.
Doctor: Have you been experiencing any other symptoms besides pain and swelling?
Patient: No, just the pain and swelling.

Patient: Alright, I'll do that.
Doctor: Have you noticed any difficulty with bending or straightening your knee?
Patient: Yeah, it's really hard for me to bend or straighten it.
Doctor: Given the possible anterior cruciate ligament tear, we may need to do some imaging tests to get a better look at your knee. 
Patient: What kind of tests will I need to do?
Doctor: We'll likely need to do an MRI to get a clearer picture of your knee.
Patient: Got it. Thanks, doc.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:Yes, the meloxicam is helping with the pain but I'm still having trouble walking and there's still some swelling.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, doctor, I haven't experienced any other symptoms besides the knee pain.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:Yes, the MRI showed that there is some inflammation in the joint which is causing the pain and swelling.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in the swelling or pain since we last spoke?
Patient: Unfortunately, no. It's still painful and swollen.

"Doctor: Hey there, how are you feeling today? 
Patient: Hi, I've been having some pain in my right elbow.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about the pain? How intense is it and where exactly is the location of the pain?
Patient: It's a really strong pain, like a sharp ache. And it's right in the middle of my elbow joint.
Doctor: Okay, on a scale of 1 to 10, how bad is the pain?
Patient: It's around a 8 or 9.
Doctor: Got it. And how long have you been experiencing this pain?
Patient: It's been hurting for a few days now, and it seems to be getting worse.
Doctor: I see. Let's take a closer look at your elbow and figure out what might be causing this pain.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about your pain?
Patient: The pain is on the inside of my elbow, and it sometimes radiates down my arm. It's a constant sharp pain, and at its worst, I would rate it a 7 out of 10. It even wakes me up at night when I roll over.
Doctor: Have you tried taking ibuprofen or using ice to relieve the pain? 
Patient: Yes, but they don't seem to help much.
Doctor: Any recent changes in your daily activities that may have caused the pain? 
Patient: Well, I've been using a pottery wheel more often than usual to create a bowl for my son. But I haven't had any specific injury that I can think of.
Doctor: Have you had any previous elbow injuries before? 
Patient: No, this is the first time I've experienced this kind of pain.

Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:Yes, my heart rate usually ranges from 110s to 130s.
Doctor: And how about your diabetes type 2? 
Patient: I don't have diabetes, but I do sometimes forget to take my metformin twice a day. My blood sugar levels range from 150 to 170 mg/dL. I have a sweet tooth, and I like baking cinnamon rolls and cakes for family gatherings. 
Doctor: I see. Do you do any exercise? 
Patient: Yes, I walk around my neighborhood for 1-2 miles every day.
Doctor: Alright, Teresa. Let's focus on your elbow pain again. Have you noticed any changes in your range of motion or ability to use your elbow since the pain started? 
Patient: Yes, it's harder to move my elbow and do things like lifting objects.
Doctor: Have you been able to continue with your daily activities despite the pain in your elbow? 
Patient: It's been difficult to work with the pottery wheel, but I can still walk and run fine.
Doctor: We'll need to evaluate your elbow further. I'll set up a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, avoid using your arm too much and try to take breaks when the pain gets worse.
Patient: Okay, thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: Hi there! How are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm alright, just dealing with some pain in my elbow.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me about any other medical conditions or surgeries in your history besides hypertension and diabetes type 2?
Patient: No, I haven't had any other surgeries or medical conditions besides those.
Doctor: How long have you been diagnosed with diabetes type 2?
Patient: It's been a while now, but I don't remember exactly when.
Doctor: Have you noticed any swelling or redness around your elbow?
Patient: No, there hasn't been any swelling or redness, just the pain.
Doctor: On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe would you rate the pain in your elbow?
Patient: I would rate it as a 7.
Doctor: Okay, we will need to do further tests and evaluations to determine what's causing the pain and how we can treat it. 
Patient: Has the pain affected your ability to perform your daily activities?
Doctor: Yes, it's been difficult to do things I used to do without feeling pain.
Doctor: I understand. We will work on finding a treatment plan to help relieve the pain and improve your range of motion. Have you tried taking any pain medication or using ice to help alleviate the pain?
Patient: Yes, I've been trying different methods to relieve the pain.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I haven't experienced any other symptoms. The medication seems to be working well and I haven't noticed any major side effects.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you had any changes in your blood pressure or blood sugar levels since starting these medications?
Patient: My blood pressure has been stable, and my doctor said my A1C has gone down since starting metformin.
Doctor: Excellent! Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight while taking metformin?
Patient: No, not really. I haven't seen any big changes in those areas.
Doctor: Okay, thanks for letting me know. I also noticed in your medical history that you have diabetes type 2. 
Patient: You know, I hadn't even thought about it before, but now that you mention it, I have had a little bit of pain in my elbow lately.
Doctor: It's always important to keep track of any new symptoms you're experiencing. Let me make a note of that and we can discuss it more at your next appointment. Overall, how has your blood sugar control been since starting metformin?

Doctor: Okay, I also noticed that your blood pressure is a bit high. Have you been monitoring it at home?
Patient: No, I haven't been keeping track of it.
Doctor: Let's keep an eye on your condition. Has your pain level changed since our last visit?
Patient: It's been pretty consistent. Some days it's worse than others.

Patient: No, I didn't notice any pain in other areas. The pain is mostly when I move my elbow.
Doctor: I see from your notes that there's no bruising, swelling or discoloration around your elbow. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. There's nothing unusual like that.
Doctor: During the examination, did you feel any pain in areas other than your elbow? 
Patient: No, the pain was only in my elbow. 
Doctor: Did you feel pain when you were moving or just when you were resting? 
Patient: Yes, it hurt when I moved it.

Doctor: No worries. Just to confirm, the x-ray showed that there are no broken bones in your right elbow. Did you notice any abnormalities in your elbow from the x-ray report? 
Patient: Nope, nothing out of the ordinary. The report showed that my elbow is perfectly fine with no fractures or other abnormalities.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Yes, I have both symptoms.""
Doctor: I noticed in your file that you've been experiencing some pain. Can you describe the type of pain you're feeling and where it's located?
Patient: It's mostly in my shoulder and lower back. I haven't been diagnosed with epicondylitis in my elbow, but it hurts a lot there too.
Doctor: Ah, I see. Well, it's important to keep an eye on that pain in your elbow. Moving on, how long have you had diabetes type 2 and hypertension?
Patient: I've had diabetes for a few years now and high blood pressure for about the same amount of time.
Doctor: Okay, have you been taking medication and making lifestyle changes to manage them?
Patient: Yes, I take pills for both and try to watch what I eat.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Have you also been monitoring your blood sugar and blood pressure levels regularly?
Patient: Yes, I check them at home every day.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""I'm doing alright. No, I haven't noticed any changes.""
Doctor: Alright. After reviewing your examination and radiographic findings, have you been experiencing increased symptoms in your elbow pain?
Patient: Yeah, my elbow still hurts, but it hasn't gotten worse.
Doctor: Okay. How often have you been taking ibuprofen 600 mg for the pain?
Patient: I take it when my elbow pain gets bad.
Doctor: Got it. How often do you exercise to manage your diabetes and hypertension?
Patient: I try to walk every day for at least 30 minutes, but sometimes I miss a day.
Doctor: That's good. How has your physical therapy been going for your epicondylitis?
Patient: It's been helping, but my elbow still hurts.
Doctor: Okay. How often do you check your blood sugar levels and Hemoglobin A1c levels?
Patient: I check my blood sugar every day, and I think my Hemoglobin A1c is due soon.

Patient: Oh, I haven't been using the sling, but I've been icing it.
Doctor: Okay. How often do you exercise to help control your hypertension?

Doctor: Good to hear. Have you talked to a nutritionist about your food choices and how they may affect your diabetes and hypertension?
Patient: No, I haven't seen one yet.
Doctor: Alright. How long do you typically exercise for, and how often do you engage in physical activity to manage your diabetes and blood pressure?

Patient: Yes, thank you for the recommendations.
Doctor: Hi there, how are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm good, thanks for asking.
Doctor: So we did a hemoglobin A1c test during our last visit.
Patient: I'm not sure what that is, can you explain it to me again?
Doctor: Sure! Hemoglobin A1c is a measure of your average blood sugar levels over time. It's an important indicator of diabetes and prediabetes.
Patient: No, I haven't been keeping track of my levels.
Doctor: Have you had any recent blood work done to check your hemoglobin A1c levels?
Patient: No, I haven't had any blood tests recently.
Doctor: Okay, let's schedule a blood test to check your hemoglobin A1c levels.
Patient: That sounds like a good idea. Can you help me schedule the appointment?"
"Doctor: Hey there, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Hi. Not great. I've been experiencing some back pain lately.
Doctor: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the type of back pain you're having? Is it a dull ache, sharp pain, or something else?
Patient: It's a dull ache.
Doctor: And when did your back pain first start?
Patient: It started a few weeks ago, but it comes and goes.
Doctor: Have you noticed any triggers for your back pain, like certain movements or activities?

Patient: Once a week for counseling. 
Doctor: Alright, and how are you feeling today? 
Patient: Just a little tired, but I think it's because I stayed up late. 
Doctor: Any symptoms or concerns bothering you right now, my friend? 
Patient: Not really, just the usual tiredness sometimes. 
Doctor: Let's talk about blood sugar management. 
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Do you know how to manage your blood sugar levels? 
Patient: To be honest, I don't know much about it. 
Doctor: Do you have diabetes or any related diseases? 
Patient: No, I don't.

Doctor: And how long have you been taking it at this dosage?
Patient: I've been on it for about six months now.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""No, not really. I have had some upset stomach, but it's nothing major.""
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, just the back pain.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the pain? How severe is it on a scale from 1 to 10? 
Patient: It's pretty bad, around an 8. 
Doctor: Okay, got it. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your feet with the back pain? 
Patient: No, just the back pain. 
Doctor: That's good to know. Have you had any injuries or accidents recently that could have caused the pain? 
Patient: Not that I can think of. I woke up one day and it was just hurting. 
Doctor: Alright, thank you for letting me know. Have you tried anything to relieve the pain? 
Patient: Yeah, I took some ibuprofen. 
Doctor: Have you experienced any headache, nausea, or fever along with the back pain? 
Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. 
Doctor: Okay, thanks for telling me. Have you been taking any medications besides metformin for your diabetes? 
Patient: No, only the metformin. 
Doctor: I see. And how have your blood sugar levels been since starting on the metformin? Have you experienced any side effects? 
Patient: My blood sugar has been fine, and I haven't had any side effects that I've noticed. 
Doctor: Great. Have you tried any exercises or stretches to help with the back pain? 
Patient: No, I haven't tried anything like that. 
Doctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing some pretty severe back pain without any numbness or tingling in your feet. Have you noticed any improvement in the pain since taking ibuprofen? 
Patient: No, unfortunately not. It's still hurting just as much.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Are there any other medications or treatments you've tried for the pain? And have you noticed any side effects from them? 
Patient: No, just the ibuprofen so far. And I haven't had any side effects from that. 
Doctor: Hi there! How are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm doing okay, thanks.
Doctor: Great. So, let's start with an examination of your eyes. Did you notice any redness, discharge, or yellowing (icterus) in your eyes recently?
Patient: No, my eyes have been fine.
Doctor: Alright. Now, let's move on to your ears, nose, mouth, and throat. When I examined your ears, I found that your auditory canal and tympanic membranes are clear. Have you experienced any issues with hearing or ear pain?
Patient: No, my ears feel fine too.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Moving on to your respiratory system, when I listened to your lungs, they were clear bilaterally. Have you had any cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain lately?
Patient: No, none of those symptoms.
Doctor: Excellent. Finally, let's talk about your musculoskeletal system. During the examination, I noticed some pain to palpation on the midline of your lower back, especially on the left side. Did you experience any pain or discomfort in your right lower back?
Patient: No, my right side felt okay.
Doctor: Okay. Also, I found a mildly positive straight leg rise on the right side and a positive straight leg rise on the left side. Do you experience any pain or numbness down your legs?
Patient: Yes, sometimes the pain goes down my left leg.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Yeah, it's been pretty bad. I haven't tried anything new to help.""
Doctor: Okay, I think it's a musculoskeletal low back strain. We'll take an x-ray just in case there's any disc issues. I'm also referring you to physical therapy to help with the pain and strengthen your back muscles. You can take 400 mg of ibuprofen up to 3 times a day and use Tylenol for severe pain. I'll give you a prescription for Flexeril too, but be careful not to overuse it if you're doing anything hazardous like driving.
Patient: Got it, thanks for all the info.
Doctor: Have you been keeping up with your diet and medications to manage your diabetes?
Patient: It's been tough to eat healthier, but I've been trying.
Doctor: How often do you check your blood sugar levels?
Patient: I don't check it that often.
Doctor: It's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you noticed any changes since our last visit?
Patient: Not really, I guess.
Doctor: Your diabetes is currently under control, but we need to make sure it stays that way. Keep up with your diet and exercise, avoid sugary foods, and continue taking metformin as prescribed.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: How has your diabetes been since our last visit?
Patient: I try to remember to check it in the morning, but sometimes I forget.
Doctor: Remember, monitoring your blood sugar levels is crucial for managing your diabetes. Are you having any problems with your medication?

Patient: It's like a sharp ache that comes and goes. Sometimes it feels like a burning sensation.
Doctor: What about any numbness or tingling in your right ankle?
Patient: Sorry, I don't have any numbness or tingling sensation in my right ankle.

Patient: It's still hurting, but like I said, it comes and goes. Sometimes it's more intense than others.
Doctor: How does your knee pain present during prolonged standing?
Patient: It becomes more intense and starts to ache more. Sometimes it feels like a sharp pain shooting through my knee.
Doctor: And how about when standing on a curb?
Patient: It hurts more when I stand on a curb, like a sharp pain shooting through my knee.
Doctor: Can you describe how your knee pain presents when squatting?
Patient: It's difficult to squat because it hurts my knee. It feels like a sharp pain and sometimes it's hard to stand back up.
Doctor: Has your ability to be active been affected by your knee pain?
Patient: Yeah, I haven't been able to do as much as I used to, especially things like running or walking for long periods of time.
Doctor: Have you noticed any new symptoms or changes in your knee pain, like locking or popping sounds?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes it feels like a grinding sensation in my knee when I move it.
Doctor: Have you tried taking ibuprofen for your knee pain?
Patient: Yes, I have. It helps a little bit, but not completely.
Doctor: Okay, let's talk about the current evaluation of your right knee pain. How does it present when standing with your ankle turned a certain way?
Patient: I haven't tried standing with my ankle turned a certain way, but it hurts more when I turn my foot inward.
Doctor: And how often do you experience pain in your right knee at rest?
Patient: It's still there, but it's not as bad as when I'm standing or moving around. It's like a dull ache.
Doctor: What about when your knee is elevated?
Patient: It doesn't hurt as much when my knee is elevated, but it's still there. It's more of a throbbing feeling.
Doctor: How about when standing on your right leg?
Patient: It's a sharp ache that comes and goes, sometimes it feels like a burning sensation. It gets worse the longer I stand.
Doctor: Can you describe any specific aspect of the pain when standing on your right leg?
Patient: It's like a sharp pain shooting through my knee, especially when I try to put weight on it.
Doctor: And how does your knee pain present during prolonged standing?
Patient: It becomes more intense and starts to ache more. Sometimes it feels like a sharp pain shooting through my knee.
Doctor: Have you experienced any relief for your knee pain?
Patient: Ibuprofen helps a little bit, and sometimes elevating my knee makes it feel better. I also ice it four times a day, which helps in the morning and at night.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:Yeah, unfortunately.
Doctor: Sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about how the pain has been presenting since your last fracture?
Patient: It hurts when I put pressure on it or walk.
Doctor: Got it. And how did you manage the previous fractures?
Patient: I rested and tried not to put too much weight on it. Sometimes I used crutches.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in the pain or appearance of your toe since the last fracture?
Patient: Yeah, the pain has been more persistent and annoying lately.
Doctor: When was the last time you fractured your 2nd toe?
Patient: About a year ago.
Doctor: Can you give me some details about the circumstances surrounding each of the three fractures?
Patient: Sure. The first time, I dropped something heavy on it. The second time, I stubbed it really hard on a piece of furniture. And the third time, I accidentally kicked a doorframe.
Doctor: Ouch, that sounds painful. Have you noticed any changes in your walking or gait since fracturing your toe?
Patient: Yeah, I've been limping a bit to avoid putting pressure on my toe.
Doctor: Have you sought medical attention for any of the fractures?
Patient: No, just the most recent one. But I didn't see a doctor for the first two.
Doctor: Have you experienced any complications or lingering effects from the fractures?
Patient: The pain has been bothering me more lately and it's harder to walk normally.
Doctor: Have you noticed any long-term effects on your other toes or feet?
Patient: No, just my 2nd toe feels weaker and stiffer than the others. And sometimes it throbs.
Doctor: Are there any specific activities or movements that tend to aggravate the pain?
Patient: Walking or standing for a long time, and wearing tight shoes makes it hurt more.
Doctor: Have you noticed any effects on your ability to exercise or play sports?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes it hurts during those activities.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, not really doc. I can still ride my bike without any issues.
Doctor: That's great to hear! What about work? Does the pain affect your ability to perform your job?
Patient: No, I'm in sales and I can still manage to work with the pain. It's not too debilitating.
Doctor: Okay, good to know. Do you experience any pain in your toe while working or riding your bike?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit of discomfort, but it's manageable. I can still do what I need to do.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Not too great, the numbness and tingling in my right toes from my prior injury hasn't really improved.""
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any positive changes or improvements at all? 
Patient: No, unfortunately it still hurts just as much. 
Doctor: Alright. How has your overall health been since we last spoke? Any positive changes? 
Patient: Nothing really, I guess I feel okay but nothing's really changed. 
Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any positive changes specifically in your right toe? 
Patient: No, it still hurts and sometimes feels numb. 
Doctor: Got it. And how about your mood and mental health? Any positives there? 
Patient: Not really, I still feel a little down sometimes and don't have much energy. 
Doctor: I see. And what about your sleep patterns or quality of sleep? 
Patient: Not really, I still struggle with falling asleep and wake up a few times during the night because of the pain.
Doctor: Hmm, that's tough. Have you noticed any positive changes in your diet or exercise habits recently? 
Patient: No, I haven't really changed anything. 
Doctor: Alright. So overall, no positive changes in your well-being then? 
Patient: Yeah, the pain in my toe makes it hard to feel good. 
Doctor: Understood. Have you noticed any positive changes in your medication or pain management techniques since our last conversation? 
Patient: No, I'm still taking the same medication and it helps a little but not enough to make a real difference. 
Doctor: I see. And has there been any improvement in your pain levels since starting the medication? 
Patient: It's pretty much stayed the same, unfortunately. 
Doctor: Okay. Well, have you noticed any positive changes in your ability to cope with the pain? 
Patient: No, it's still really difficult to deal with. 
Doctor: I understand. Have you noticed any positive changes in your daily activities despite the ongoing pain? 
Patient: Not really, the pain makes it hard to do things I used to enjoy. 
Doctor: I see. And has there been any improvement in your range of motion or flexibility in your right toe? 
Patient: No, it still feels stiff and hard to move sometimes. 
Doctor: Alright. Well, thanks for answering my questions. If you think of anything else, feel free to give me a call. 
Patient: Thank you, doc.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I haven't had any other symptoms. My feet and legs feel fine.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Is there anything specific that you want to talk about today?
Patient: Well, I did have some abnormal levels in my labs and my EKG showed a higher reading. 
Doctor: Okay, thanks for letting me know. Have there been any changes in your labs or EKG results? Some levels were not normal before, so I want to make sure we keep an eye on it.
Patient: No, I don't think there have been any changes since the last time we checked.
Doctor: Alright, let's schedule another appointment to check up on those levels.
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any numbness in my right side or any prior injuries.
Doctor: Good to know. Have you been having any trouble breathing or experiencing chest pain recently?
Patient: No, I haven't had any issues with that either.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I didn't experience any other symptoms. It didn't hurt at all.
Doctor: That's good to hear. During your examination, did you notice any slight discomfort or swelling in your knee?
Patient: My knee felt fine, I didn't feel any pain or swelling.
Doctor: Great! During your last examination, did you notice any slight positive changes in your condition or in your right knee?
Patient: I didn't notice any changes, but the varus test was positive and my range of motion was full.
Doctor: Okay, that's helpful information. And did you notice any negative changes in your knee during the examination?
Patient: No, I didn't feel any changes or pain in my knee during the examination. The Lachman's test was negative as well.
Doctor: Alright, thank you for letting me know. Based on your feedback, it seems like your knee is doing well overall.
Doctor: I see that you had some imaging done on your right knee. Can you tell me more about it?
Patient: Yeah, they took some pictures of my knee and the doctor said there was an abnormality detected.
Doctor: I see in your imaging report that there were no fractures, dislocations or bony abnormalities detected in your knee. Can you tell me more about how your knee has been feeling lately? Have you had any pain or trouble walking?
Patient: My knee has been hurting a lot, and it's hard for me to walk around or move my knee.
Doctor: Based on the imaging report, were there any signs of fractures or dislocations in your knee?
Patient: No, there weren't any fractures or dislocations. But the doctor did say there was an abnormality detected.
Doctor: How has the pain in your knee been?
Patient: My knee has been hurting for a while now.
Doctor: Did the imaging show any specific issues or injuries in your knee?
Patient: The imaging didn't show any fractures or dislocations. But the doctor did say there was an abnormality detected.
Doctor: Can you describe the pain you have been feeling in your knee? Has it been hard for you to walk around or move your knee?
Patient: The pain is really sharp and intense, and it's been hard for me to walk around or move my knee.
Doctor: I see from your imaging report that there were no fractures, dislocations, or bony abnormalities detected in your knee. Can you tell me more about the pain you've been feeling and how long it's been going on?
Patient: The pain has been going on for a while now, and it's really intense. It's hard for me to walk around or move my knee.
Doctor: I see that there were no fractures, dislocations, or bony abnormalities detected in your knee imaging. Can you tell me more about any other symptoms you've been experiencing besides the knee pain?
Patient: I've also been having some headaches lately, but I don't know if they're related to my knee pain.
Doctor: I see that there were no fractures, dislocations, or bony abnormalities detected in your knee imaging. Did you have any other symptoms besides the knee pain and headaches?
Patient: No, those are the only symptoms I've been experiencing.
Doctor: I see from your imaging report that there were no fractures, dislocations, or bony abnormalities detected in your knee. Can you tell me more about how long the knee pain has been going on for and if there are any specific triggers that make it worse?
Patient: The knee pain has been going on for a while now, and it's really sharp and intense. There aren't any specific triggers that make it worse.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, just the pain in my right knee.
Doctor: Ah, I see from your medical records that you have a lateral collateral ligament strain in that knee. Can you tell me more about it?
Patient: Yeah, I injured it playing basketball with some friends. Made a sudden move and felt something pop.
Doctor: Ouch! Have you tried any treatments for it?
Patient: Yeah, I've been icing it and taking some pain relievers, but it hasn't been helping much.
Doctor: Alright, can you describe the type of pain you're feeling? Is it sharp or more of an ache?
Patient: It's definitely more of an ache.
Doctor: Okay, did you have any imaging done on your knee?
Patient: Yes, they took some pictures to see what was wrong with it.
Doctor: Do you know if there were any abnormalities or fractures found in the imaging?
Patient: I'm not really sure, sorry.
Doctor: No problem. Did they say anything about your white blood cell count during your visit?
Patient: Not that I remember, but the last time I got tested it was normal.
Doctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Based on your symptoms and history, I'd like to examine your knee and potentially order more imaging to get a better idea of what's going on. Are you okay with that?
Patient: Of course, whatever it takes to figure out what's wrong.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: So, after reviewing your examination and radiographic findings, I recommend treating your knee conservatively with formal physical therapy to strengthen it. I've also prescribed meloxicam 15 mg for your pain. Have you been taking the medication as prescribed?
Patient: Yes, I have been taking it.
Doctor: That's correct. Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles around your knee and improve your range of motion, which can help alleviate your symptoms. Would you like me to refer you to a physical therapist?
Doctor: Exactly! Physical therapy can really help improve your knee strength and relieve your pain. Have you started physical therapy yet or had any follow-up x-rays done to check for any changes in your knee?
Patient: Yes, I've been going to physical therapy and haven't noticed anything abnormal during my exercises.
Doctor: That's great to hear! Have you noticed any improvements in your knee since starting physical therapy?
Patient: Yes, my knee doesn't hurt as much as before.

"Doctor: Hey there, Dennis! How's it going today?
Patient: Hi, I'm feeling alright.
Doctor: So, you came in today because of some pain in your right heel. When did that start?
Patient: Yeah, it started about 10 days ago while I was training for a triathlon.
Doctor: Got it. And where would you say the pain is located exactly?
Patient: It's in the back part of my heel, and sometimes I feel it going up into my calf.
Doctor: Does anything make the pain worse or better?
Patient: Working out definitely aggravates it, and it's usually pretty bad when I first get up in the morning. Also, if I sit for too long, the pain comes back when I stand up.
Doctor: Ahh, okay. You mentioned you do quite a bit of exercise. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Sure. I run about 10 kilometers in the morning, then bike for 45 minutes to an hour at lunchtime. In the evening, I swim for 30 minutes to an hour at the aquatic center.
Doctor: Wow, that's a lot! How often do you do all of that?
Patient: I run 5 days per week, and on weekends I alternate between a long run and a long bike ride. I take one day off each week.
Doctor: Do you stretch before or after exercising?
Patient: Actually, I don't stretch at all.
Doctor: Okay. Have you experienced any pain in your left leg?
Patient: No, none at all. Just the right heel pain.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: So, I see that you've been experiencing some right heel pain. Have you tried any treatments or home remedies yet? 
Patient: No, I haven't done anything about it yet. 
Doctor: Do you notice any swelling in the affected area? 
Patient: No, I don't think so. 
Doctor: Have you ever had any foot or ankle injuries before? 
Patient: Nope, never had any problems with my feet before. 
Doctor: Has the intensity or location of your pain changed since we last spoke? 
Patient: No, it's still hurting in the same spot and feels the same as before. 
Doctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any left leg pain recently? 
Patient: No, just the pain in my right heel. 
Doctor: And how long has this pain been going on for? 
Patient: It's been about a week now. 
Doctor: How often do you feel the pain? 
Patient: Pretty much all the time, but it gets worse when I walk or stand for too long. 
Doctor: Does anything make the pain better or worse?
Patient: Walking and standing for too long makes it hurt more, and resting and sitting down seems to make it feel a little better, but it still hurts.
Doctor: Can you describe the exact location of the pain in your heel? Is it towards the front or back of your foot? 
Patient: It's on the bottom of my heel. 
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I didn't feel any pain when you extended or flexed my right heel. But I have been experiencing some discomfort and stiffness in my left ankle.
Doctor: Okay. And did you feel any tenderness during the exam of your right heel?
Patient: Yes, there was some soreness when you pressed on it.
Doctor: How about mild pain during the squeeze test? Did you experience any discomfort then?
Patient: Yes, when you squeezed my heel, it did cause some pain.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Yeah, I've had some symptoms in the past, but it was before I started feeling sick.""
Doctor: Do you recall when those previous scans or X-rays were taken and what they were for?
Patient: Sorry, I don't really remember the dates or reasons for them. It was a few years ago when I was having some stomach problems.
Doctor: Can you share more about those stomach issues you had at that time?
Patient: Sure, I was experiencing a lot of pain and bloating, and my digestion wasn't great. Sometimes, I even felt nauseous. 
Doctor: How have you been doing since we started your current treatment plan? Any improvements in your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I do feel a bit better now. The pain has reduced, and I'm not as bloated or nauseous as before. However, I still experience discomfort from time to time.
Doctor: Are you following the medication regimen and treatment plan as instructed?
Patient: Yes, I am trying my best to take the medications on time every day, just like you told me to.
Doctor: Great! But regarding your abnormal lab results, we may need to conduct further tests to determine what's happening. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment.
Patient: Okay, sounds good.
Doctor: Speaking of which, how's your heel feeling? Have you noticed any changes or improvements since we last checked it?
Patient: Actually, no, I haven't seen any improvements. It still hurts when I walk on it.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. I'm feeling good, thank you.
Doctor: So, I see in your notes that you've been experiencing some pain in your right Achilles. 
Patient: It's been bothering me for a few weeks now. It can get pretty bad and makes it hard to walk or stand for too long.
Doctor: I understand, that must be tough. Have you tried anything to alleviate the pain? Like home remedies or over-the-counter medication?
Patient: Not really, I was hoping you could give me some suggestions.
Doctor: Sure, I can recommend some pain relievers and stretches that can help with your tendinitis. Have you had any imaging done recently for your symptoms?
Patient: No, not for my Achilles pain.
Doctor: Okay, I'll make sure to order some imaging for your Achilles pain. Have you noticed any other symptoms lately?
Patient: I've been feeling really bloated in my stomach for a few days now.
Doctor: Can you describe your stomach issues and how long you've been experiencing them?
Patient: It's just a really uncomfortable bloating sensation that hasn't gone away for a few days now.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Yeah, I've been training a lot but my right Achilles has been hurting.""
Doctor: After our discussion and examination, it looks like your symptoms are likely due to overuse from your training. 
Patient: No, not really. But I have been taking ibuprofen and doing physical therapy.
Doctor: How's that been working for you? Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms?
Patient: It's been okay, but the pain is still there.
Doctor: How have your physical therapy appointments been going? Are you attending them regularly and doing your exercises as directed by the therapist?
Patient: Yes, I am. And I've been taking the ibuprofen like you told me to.
Doctor: If your pain doesn't improve with physical therapy, we may need to get an x-ray. I'm going to give you a referral for formal physical therapy to strengthen your right lower extremities. And I recommend taking at least a week off from your training to recover.
Patient: Okay, thanks for letting me know.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I haven't experienced any other symptoms. I've been feeling alright and have been taking my medications as instructed.
Doctor: That's great. Has your pain level improved at all in the past few days?
Patient: Unfortunately not. It's still around a 7 or 8.
Doctor: Okay, let's talk about your exercise routine. Have you noticed any improvements in your flexibility or strength since we last spoke?
Patient: I haven't made any changes to my routine, but I've been keeping up with it like we talked about before.
Doctor: How has your adherence to the medication regimen been?
Patient: No side effects thankfully, and I've been taking them as directed.
Doctor: Have you noticed any progress in your pain level?
Patient: No, unfortunately my pain level hasn't really improved.
Doctor: Alright, let's touch on physical therapy. 
Patient: Unfortunately not yet. My pain is still the same."
"Doctor: Hey there! So, I see you have a non-healing ulcer on your right foot.
Patient: Yeah, it's been there for a while now.
Doctor: How long has it been there? Have you tried any treatments to heal it?
Patient: I can't remember exactly how long. I've tried using ointment and covering it up, but it hasn't improved much.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. Have you been feeling down or having trouble sleeping lately?
Patient: Actually, yes. I've been feeling pretty low and struggling with sleep.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. And have you experienced any chest pain or shortness of breath recently?
Patient: Yeah, the chest pain comes and goes. Sometimes it feels tight and I can't catch my breath.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: So, besides your type 2 diabetes and neuropathy, do you have any other medical conditions that we should know about?
Patient: No, just those two.
Doctor: Okay, let's talk about your right foot ulcer. When did you first notice it?
Patient: It started about a year ago. There wasn't a specific injury or anything, it just seemed like a blister at first and then turned red when I picked at it.
Doctor: And have you been to see a doctor about it before?
Patient: Yes, my primary care physician prescribed me Keflex antibiotics and they helped a bit, but didn't completely resolve the issue. That was about 5 months ago.
Doctor: I see. How is your pain level currently?
Patient: Actually, I don't have any pain right now.
Doctor: That's good to hear. But you mentioned decreased sensation in your foot. Is that still an issue?
Patient: Yes, unfortunately. 
Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any improvement since wearing the recommended footwear?
Patient: Honestly, I haven't noticed much of a difference yet.
Doctor: Alright. You also mentioned increased drainage and fatigue. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Well, sometimes there's just more fluid coming from the wound than usual. And I've been feeling more tired lately, even though I haven't changed anything in my routine.
Doctor: I understand. Now, let's talk about your diabetes. How are your blood sugars doing?
Patient: They're better than they were before, but still around 200.
Doctor: And when was your last hemoglobin A1C test?
Patient: About 10.
Doctor: Got it. Finally, have you noticed any other symptoms or issues that we haven't discussed yet?
Patient: No, just the foot ulcer and decreased sensation. 
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:Yes, I've been feeling a bit tired lately.
Doctor: I remember you have a foot ulcer on your right foot. Have you noticed any changes in its appearance or size recently? 
Patient: Yes, it's been looking a little bigger and there's been more drainage than usual. 
Doctor: That's concerning. Have you noticed any changes in the skin around the ulcer? 
Patient: Yes, it's been really itchy and irritated. 
Doctor: I see. Any redness or swelling around the area? 
Patient: No, just the itching and irritation. 
Doctor: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in the color or texture of the skin around the ulcer? 
Patient: No, I don't think so.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Well, I do have this foot ulcer that's been bothering me. It looks different now and has changed in size and color.""
Doctor: Alright, let's take a closer look at it then. Can you tell me more about the changes in its appearance?
Patient: The ulcer is bigger now and the color has changed too.
Doctor: Have you experienced any chest pain or shortness of breath lately?
Patient: Yes, actually. I've been having chest pain and shortness of breath.
Doctor: Oh, I see. When does the chest pain and shortness of breath usually occur? Do you notice any patterns or triggers?
Patient: Not really, it just happens randomly.
Doctor: Okay, we'll monitor these symptoms closely and try to identify any patterns if they exist. How have you been feeling since our last visit?
Patient: My foot ulcer still looks the same, but my chest pain and shortness of breath have been happening more frequently.
Doctor: Understood. Let's take another look at your foot ulcer and make sure it's not worsening.
Doctor: Regarding your foot ulcer, can you describe the wound in more detail?
Patient: The wound on my right foot is about 1.0 cm x 2.0 cm in size. Sometimes it hurts a little bit around the wound, but I don't think there's any redness or warmth.
Doctor: Let's examine your foot ulcer. Are there any changes to its aspect since your last visit?
Patient: The wound on my foot looks the same as before. It's still there and it hasn't improved yet.
Doctor: Can you tell me if there is any slough or granulation tissue present in the wound?
Patient: Sorry, I don't really understand what you mean by that. Can you explain it to me?
Doctor: During the examination, is there any tenderness or swelling present in the area around the foot ulcer?
Patient: Sometimes it hurts a little bit around the wound, but I don't think there's any swelling.
Doctor: During the examination, is there any sign of erythema or warmth around the wound?
Patient: I don't see any redness or feel any heat coming from the wound.
Doctor: During the examination, is there any fluid or necrosis present in the foot ulcer? And is there any drainage or odor coming from the wound?
Patient: I don't see any fluid in the wound and there's no bad smell coming from it either.
Doctor: During the examination, did you notice any signs of cellulitis or necrosis around the foot ulcer?
Patient: I'm not sure what that means, but I don't see anything unusual around the wound.
Doctor: During the examination, did you notice any signs of necrosis or sensitivity to palpation around the foot ulcer?
Patient: I don't think so. It just hurts a little bit sometimes, but I don't feel any sensitivity to touch.
Doctor: During the examination, is there any improvement in the appearance of the foot ulcer?
Patient: I haven't noticed any changes in the wound, it still looks the same as before.
Doctor: During the examination, is there any sign that the foot ulcer is getting worse?
Patient: I haven't noticed any changes like that, but it still worries me that it won't heal.
Doctor: During the examination, is there any sign of improvement in your overall condition? Are there any other symptoms that you have noticed getting better or worse?
Patient: Sorry, I haven't really noticed any changes in my overall condition or any other symptoms.
Doctor: During the examination, is there any sign of drainage or odor coming from the foot ulcer?
Patient: No, there's no liquid coming out of the wound and there's no bad smell either.
Doctor: During the examination, were there any abnormalities or concerns that you noticed? Is there anything in particular that you're worried about?
Patient: I'm just worried that the wound won't heal and it will cause more problems for me.
Doctor: During the examination, is there anything else that you would like to mention or ask about your foot ulcer? Any concerns or questions that you have?
Patient: No, I don't think so.
Doctor: Hi there! How are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm doing okay, thanks for asking.
Doctor: So, I have good news. According to your X-ray report, there's no evidence of osteomyelitis in your right foot.
Patient: Oh, that's a relief. What exactly is osteomyelitis?
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, just the pain in my foot.
Doctor: Ah yes, I see in your file that you have a diabetic foot ulcer on your right foot. How's that been?
Patient: Yeah, it's been pretty painful and it's been hard to walk sometimes.
Doctor: Have you been following the treatment plan we discussed for the ulcer?
Patient: Yes, I've been trying to keep it clean and use the ointment that you prescribed.
Doctor: That's good to hear. How often are you changing the dressing and applying the ointment?
Patient: I change it every day and put on the ointment.
Doctor: Excellent. Have you noticed any improvement in the pain or the appearance of the ulcer?
Patient: No, not really. It still hurts a lot and looks about the same.
Doctor: Okay, I'm going to take a closer look at the ulcer and see if there are any signs of infection. Also, have you been monitoring your blood sugar levels? High blood sugar can make the ulcer worse.
Patient: Yeah, I've been checking my blood sugar levels every day like you told me to.
Doctor: Great job. Keep it up and let's continue to monitor your progress with the current treatment plan. If the pain doesn't improve, we may need to consider other options such as antibiotics or debridement.
Patient: Alright, thanks for letting me know. I'll keep following the plan and reach out if I have any concerns or questions.
Doctor: Sounds good. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check on your progress with the ulcer and discuss any other health concerns you may have.
Patient: Sure, that works for me. Thanks for being so thorough, doc.
Doctor: Of course, always happy to help. And by the way, have you experienced any other symptoms related to your osteomyelitis?
Patient: Sorry, what's osteomyelitis?
Doctor: It's an infection in the bone. We noticed it on your X-ray report.
Patient: Oh, I see. No, I haven't had any new symptoms since we last talked about it.
Doctor: Okay, good to know. And how is the pain from the osteomyelitis? Has it been affecting your foot as well?
Patient: Yeah, the pain has been pretty constant and I think it's contributing to my foot pain too.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I haven't experienced any other symptoms. I've been doing okay, thanks.
Doctor: So, have you noticed any changes in the size or color of your wound since we last spoke?
Patient: To be honest, I'm not sure. What should I be looking for?
Doctor: Well, ideally we want to see a decrease in the size of the ulcer and no changes in color. That's why I recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index to check the blood supply to your foot. This will help us see if we can heal the wound.
Patient: Oh, I see. And how about the collagenase ointment you prescribed? How is it working?
Doctor: That's a good question. Have you seen any progress in healing since you started using it?
Patient: It's hard to tell. I've been applying it once a day like you said, and covering it with a sterile dressing.
Doctor: Good, that's exactly what we want you to do. Please continue until we see the ulcer decrease in size. Also, how often are you changing the sterile dressing on your foot ulcer?
Patient: I think I've been changing it every other day.
Doctor: Okay, it might be better if you change it daily to keep the area clean and protected. Have you had any increased pain or discomfort when wearing the surgical shoe?
Patient: No, it's been alright.
Doctor: Great. Another thing to consider is debridement as a treatment option for the ulcer. We could perform this in office today, if you're interested.

Patient: Sometimes it happens when I'm doing something active, like going up stairs.
Doctor: Alright, so the chest pain happens when you're doing something active like going up stairs. I understand it's not constant. We will need to do some tests to check on your condition and make sure everything is okay. Have you had any recent labs done to check on your kidney function or thyroid levels?

Patient: I don't really keep track, but I usually go for a regular checkup once or twice a year and my doctor tells me if I need more tests.
Doctor: Do you think getting your labs checked once a year during your checkup is enough to ensure they stay within normal limits?
Patient: Yes, I think so. But if you recommend more frequent testing, I'll follow your advice.
Doctor: Great. Have you noticed any recent changes in your overall health that could affect your lab results staying within normal limits?
Patient: No, everything has been pretty much the same as usual.

Patient: Yes, the swelling has increased and the pitting seems to be getting worse.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:I'm sorry, I didn't understand. What do you mean by other symptoms?
Doctor: Yeah, during the examination today, I noticed that your EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and no other heart issues. But we use an echocardiogram to get a better look at how your heart is functioning.
Patient: Did you notice any changes in my R wave progression during the EKG?
Doctor: No, your R wave progression looked good. However, based on your symptoms and our results, I want to order an echocardiogram. It's a test where we use sound waves to take pictures of your heart and see if everything is working properly.
Patient: Got it. Do you think everything will be okay?
Doctor: Well, based on what we've seen so far, I anticipate ordering an echocardiogram just to make sure everything is alright with your heart. 
Patient: Okay, that makes sense. What does the echocardiogram show?
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. I'm doing alright, thanks for asking.
Doctor: Based on the results of your recent echocardiogram, do you have any questions about the treatment plan for your heart condition?

Doctor: Okay, good to know. 
Patient: Not really, can you explain it to me in simpler terms?
Doctor: Basically, your heart is not pumping blood as efficiently as it should be, but given your history and compliance with medication, we believe that it will improve over time.
Patient: Oh, okay. So what should I do in the meantime?
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. But I am concerned about my acute heart failure. What can we do about that?
Doctor: We'll prescribe Lasix 40 mg once a day and add Aldactone 12.5 mg daily to help with fluid retention. We'll also order lab work and obtain another echo in about two months to monitor your progress.
Patient: Okay, sounds good. And what about my hypertension? Is that under control?
Doctor: Yes, your blood pressure is well controlled, but I recommend continuing to exercise and being mindful of your diet. You may want to consider reducing the amount of preserved meats you consume. We can also refer you to nutrition counseling for more options.
Patient: And what about my type 2 diabetes?
Doctor: Your blood glucose levels seem stable, so just continue monitoring them and taking your metformin as prescribed.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: Of course! Do you have any other questions or concerns?

"Doctor: Hey there, how's it going? Can you tell me a bit about the pain you're experiencing in your right hand?
Patient: Hi! Yeah, my right hand hurts a lot. It's a sharp ache that sometimes throbs.
Doctor: Okay, got it. How often does the pain occur?
Patient: It's pretty much constant, but it gets worse when I try to do things like grip or hold something.
Doctor: I see. Has the pain affected your daily activities at all?
Patient: Definitely. It's been hard to open jars, write, and even hold things.
Doctor: That sounds tough. Have you tried any treatments for the pain?
Patient: I've been taking over-the-counter pain meds and using ice packs on my hand.
Doctor: Any improvement with those methods?
Patient: A little bit, but the pain is still there and my hand looks swollen and feels warm to the touch.
Doctor: Gotcha. How long have you been dealing with this pain?
Patient: It's been a few weeks now.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. I'm feeling good, thank you.
Doctor: So what brings you in today?
Patient: Well, I've been having some pain in my right hand and it's been bothering me for a while now.
Doctor: Can you describe the pain you're experiencing?
Patient: Yeah, it's like a sharp ache that goes down my fingers and makes them feel tingly and numb.
Doctor: When does the pain usually occur?
Patient: It happens pretty much every day when I'm using my computer at work. The pain and numbness are really annoying.
Doctor: How long have you been experiencing sleep disturbance due to your right hand pain?
Patient: For the past couple of weeks or so, I haven't been sleeping well because the pain keeps waking me up.
Doctor: And how often have you been taking ibuprofen for your symptoms?
Patient: Almost every day for the past week or so to try and relieve the pain.
Doctor: Has the medication been helpful?
Patient: It helps for a little while, but the pain always comes back.
Doctor: Have you noticed any other areas of your body where you experience intermittent pain besides your right hand?
Patient: No, just my right hand.
Doctor: Okay, and have you had any previous evaluations for this pain?
Patient: No, this is the first time I've talked to a doctor about it.
Doctor: Got it. Have you noticed any specific activities or motions that trigger the pain in your right hand?
Patient: Yeah, it usually happens when I'm using my computer or typing for a long time.
Doctor: And how would you rate the intensity of your pain on a scale from 1 to 10?
Patient: It's probably around a 7 or 8 most of the time.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, no other symptoms.
Doctor: Any pain or discomfort from typing?
Patient: Sometimes my hands get sore after a long day of typing, but it's not too bad.
Doctor: How long does it usually take for the pain to go away?
Patient: Usually it goes away after I rest my hands for a little while.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about your immigration and education?
Patient: Yeah, I moved here from my home country and finished high school here in the US.
Doctor: How did you find the transition from your home country to this one? 
Patient: It was tough at first, but I got used to it. 
Doctor: Have you ever used drugs or gone to counseling before?
Patient: No, I haven't. 
Doctor: And how has your educational background in your home country influenced your career choices or opportunities here in the US?
Patient: Well, it prepared me for my current job and helped me obtain it.
Doctor: I see in your notes that you've been taking ibuprofen. Can you tell me how often you take it and for what reason? 
Patient: Yeah, I take it for headaches. Maybe once or twice a week. 
Doctor: Okay, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any side effects from taking ibuprofen? 
Patient: No, not really. It seems to help with the headaches. 
Doctor: That's good to hear. Just keep in mind that taking too much ibuprofen can have negative effects on your stomach and kidneys. So, try not to take more than the recommended dosage. 
Patient: Okay, thank you for the advice.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms. I'm doing alright, thanks for asking.
Doctor: So, I see in your notes that you've been experiencing pain, numbness and tingling in your right hand. Can you tell me more about that? 
Patient: Yeah, my first three fingers on my right hand have been hurting a lot lately, and sometimes they feel kind of numb and tingly too.
Doctor: That doesn't sound comfortable at all. Have you noticed any sleep disturbance due to the tingling in your hand? 
Patient: It does wake me up sometimes, but I can usually go back to sleep after a few minutes.
Doctor: Okay, let's focus on your hand for now. Can you describe where exactly you feel the tingling? 
Patient: It's in my first, second, and third fingers on my right hand.
Doctor: Got it. Any swelling or allergies that you know of? 
Patient: No swelling, and I don't think I have any allergies either.
Doctor: Alright. Have you been taking any medication for the pain or discomfort in your hand? 
Patient: No, not yet. 
Doctor: Understood. And just to check, have you experienced any fever, cough, sore throat, or headache recently? 
Patient: No, none of those symptoms.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: So, I noticed in your records that you've been experiencing some pain and decreased grip strength in your right hand. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yeah, it's been bothering me for a while now. Whenever I move my wrist, it hurts pretty bad.
Doctor: Okay, let me take a look at your hand. Have you noticed any tingling or numbness in your fingers on the right hand?
Patient: Yes, actually I have. It's mostly in my thumb and first two fingers.
Doctor: Got it. 
Patient: Um, I'm not sure what that is.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Yeah, I've been dealing with some pain and numbness due to the carpal tunnel syndrome in my right hand. Have you got any suggestions for home remedies to alleviate it?""
Doctor: It's great that you're aware of your condition.
Patient: Is there anything else I can do to make it better? Maybe something like hand exercises?
Doctor: Absolutely! Doing regular hand exercises can help improve your grip strength. I can show you some exercises during our next appointment. If the pain and numbness persist, we can schedule you for a nerve conduction test to assess how well your nerves are working in your hand. 
Patient: Sounds good. How long should I continue with the home remedies and hand exercises before considering a nerve conduction test?
Doctor: Let's monitor your symptoms and see if they improve with the home remedies and hand exercises. If not, let me know and we can discuss scheduling a nerve conduction test. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other concerns or questions. 
Patient: Thanks for all the advice, doc! I'll be sure to keep track of any changes and let you know if I need further assistance. 
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""I've been okay, but I still experience some pain and numbness in my wrist.""
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, it seems like you have carpal tunnel syndrome. Have you tried any treatments for this before?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: Alright, well we can start with conservative treatment such as nighttime wrist splinting and ibuprofen. 
Doctor: I will increase your ibuprofen dose to 600 mg four times a day.
Patient: It's been helping a little bit, but I still have some pain.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms with the increased dose of ibuprofen four times a day and using the wrist splint at night?
Patient: Yes, it's been helping a little.
Doctor: Have you considered physical therapy or other non-surgical interventions for your carpal tunnel syndrome before?
Patient: No, I haven't. What do you recommend?
Doctor: Well, if your symptoms persist, we may need to consider a nerve conduction study to further evaluate your condition and determine if surgical intervention is necessary.
Patient: What's a nerve conduction study?
Doctor: It's a test to see how well your nerves are functioning and can give us more information about the severity of your carpal tunnel syndrome. If surgery is needed, it involves a carpal tunnel release procedure to relieve pressure on the nerves in your wrist.
Patient: Do I really need surgery?

Doctor: Have you been having any headaches lately? And how often and how long do they usually last?
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any headaches recently. 
Patient: But my elbow is still swollen and painful. Does the abnormal blood work have anything to do with that?

Patient: It's still hurting and swollen, but it's not as bad as before.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Any other symptoms you've noticed besides the elbow pain?

Patient: Yes, I've been checking them regularly and they seem to be under control. 
Doctor: That's good to hear. We'll keep you on metformin 500 mg and order a hemoglobin A1c to evaluate any need for medication adjustments. And we'll continue to monitor your hypertension and keep you on lisinopril 20 mg daily. Sound good? 
Patient: Sounds good to me. Thank you, doc.

Doctor: Let's focus on treating your lower back pain then. We can try some other methods like elevation and physical therapy exercises. And if the pain persists, we can look into getting imaging done to see if there's anything more serious going on. Sound good?
Patient: Yeah, that sounds good to me.
Doctor: I see that you enjoy playing soccer. How often do you play?
Patient: Once a week for the community league.
Doctor: Has your back pain affected your ability to play?
Patient: Sometimes my lower back hurts during and after the game, but I try not to let it stop me from playing.
Doctor: How long have you been playing soccer?
Patient: I've been playing since I was a kid. It's always been my favorite sport.
Doctor: Have you noticed if the pain gets worse after playing soccer?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes it does, especially if we have a really intense game. But I usually take some pain relievers and stretch afterwards.
Doctor: How frequently do you experience lower back pain after playing soccer?
Patient: It happens pretty much every time I play, but it's not too bad. I just try to manage it with some rest and stretching.
Doctor: Has playing soccer affected your overall physical health positively or negatively?
Patient: Overall, I think playing soccer has been good for my physical health. It keeps me active and helps me stay in shape.
Doctor: That's great to hear! Do you have any other physical activities that you enjoy doing besides playing soccer?
Patient: Not really, soccer is my main thing. But I try to stay active by going for walks or bike rides when I can.
Doctor: Well, it sounds like you're doing a great job staying active and taking care of yourself. Keep up the good work!
Patient: Thanks, doc! Will do.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, just the pain and soreness when I walk on it. It's been hurting for a few days now.
Doctor: Do you remember how the pain started? Did you twist your ankle or injure it in any way?
Patient: Not really, it just started hurting one day out of nowhere.
Doctor: Have you tried anything to ease the pain?
Patient: No, I haven't done anything yet.
Doctor: Does the pain affect your daily activities?
Patient: Yeah, it makes it hard to walk and run like I usually do.
Doctor: Have you noticed any swelling or bruising around the ankle?
Patient: No, I don't see any visible signs of swelling or bruising.
Doctor: Has there been any improvement in the pain since it started?
Patient: No, it's been consistent.
Doctor: I understand you've been experiencing right ankle pain for a few days now. The pain is affecting your daily activities and hasn't improved with time. We'll need to take a closer look and maybe do an X-ray or other tests to figure out what's causing the pain. We'll get you sorted out soon!
Doctor: That's great to hear. I just wanted to let you know that your vital signs look good today.
Patient: Oh, that's good news!
Doctor: Yes, everything looks normal and within healthy ranges.
Patient: Thank you for letting me know.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:Yeah, my feet and ankles have been getting swollen for a few days now.
Doctor: How long have you been noticing the swelling in your feet and ankles?
Patient: It's been going on for a few days now. They just feel puffy and bloated.
Doctor: Have you noticed any other symptoms besides the swelling in your feet and ankles?
Patient: No, not really. Just a bit of discomfort when I walk around.
Doctor: Have you tried any home remedies to reduce the swelling?
Patient: Yeah, I've been elevating my feet and using ice packs.
Doctor: Has the swelling gone down at all with those remedies?
Patient: It's gone down a little bit, but not completely.
Doctor: Any recent changes in your diet or exercise routine that could be contributing to the swelling?
Patient: No, nothing out of the ordinary.
Doctor: Have you ever experienced edema or swelling in other parts of your body before?
Patient: No, this is the first time I've had this issue.
Doctor: Have you noticed any redness or warmth in the swollen areas?
Patient: No, they don't feel warm or look red to me.
Doctor: Have you had any kidney or heart problems in the past?
Patient: No, never had any issues with either of those.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms and medical history, I'd like to order some further tests to figure out what's causing the edema. Is that okay with you?
Patient: Sure, whatever you think is best.
Doctor: On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe would you say the swelling is?
Patient: I'd say it's about a 5.
Doctor: Have you experienced any numbness or tingling sensations in your feet or ankles?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed anything like that.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement in the swelling since you started using ice packs and elevating your feet?
Patient: It's gone down a bit, but not completely.
Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications that could be causing the edema?
Patient: Nope, not on any medications right now.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: Let's start by checking on your sensations. Have you noticed any changes since your last visit? 
Patient: No, everything feels normal to me. 
Doctor: That's great to hear! Have you experienced any abnormal sensations like tingling or numbness anywhere in your body? 
Patient: Nope, nothing like that. 
Doctor: How about your sleeping patterns?
Patient: I've been having trouble falling asleep and waking up earlier than usual.
Doctor: Okay, thanks for letting me know. What about your bowel movements? Are they still regular and normal for you? 
Patient: Yup, they're all good. 
Doctor: Have you noticed any other abnormal symptoms or changes in your body that are different from what you usually experience? 
Patient: No, everything else feels pretty normal. 
Doctor: Alright, let's talk about your appetite. Have you noticed any changes in your normal food intake or hunger levels? 
Patient: Now that you mention it, I have been feeling less hungry than usual. 
Doctor: Noted. Besides the swelling we talked about earlier, have you noticed any other abnormal changes in your body? 
Patient: No, everything else feels normal to me. 
Doctor: Great to hear. How about your menstrual cycle, have you noticed any abnormal changes there? 
Patient: I don't keep track of it, but I don't think anything is off. 
Doctor: And have you experienced any other abnormal symptoms besides the swelling? 
Patient: Nope, everything else feels pretty normal to me. 
Doctor: Based on our conversation and your recent lab results, it seems like everything is within the normal range. Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms since your last visit? 
Patient: No, everything feels the same. 
Doctor: That's good to hear. Are all of your symptoms currently within the normal range for you? 
Patient: Yeah, besides the swelling, everything else is pretty much the same as usual. 
Doctor: And all of your recent lab results are within the normal range? 
Patient: Yes, except for the edema and swelling we discussed earlier. 
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, just the swelling and pain in my ankle.
Doctor: Let's start by examining your ankle. Do you feel any stress or anxiety right now?
Patient: No, just concerned about my ankle.
Doctor: Alright, let's take a look at it. Is there any discoloration or bruising on your ankle?
Patient: Yes, there is ecchymosis present.
Doctor: I see. And do you still feel swelling over the lateral malleolus?
Patient: Yes, it's still swollen.
Doctor: Let me check for tenderness. Does it hurt when I press here? (points to anterolateral soft tissue)
Patient: Yes, that's tender to palpation.
Doctor: Okay, let's check for any instability in your ankle. During our examination earlier, did you notice any laxity on anterior drawer and inversion stress?
Patient: No, there was no laxity.
Doctor: Good. Now let me check for bony tenderness on palpation of your foot. Any pain here? (presses on various points on patient's foot)
Patient: No, I don't feel any pain there.
Doctor: Great. How about sensation? Do you notice any abnormal sensations in your ankle besides the tenderness and swelling?
Patient: No, everything feels normal.
Doctor: Alright, let me check capillary refill and pulse. (checks patient's dorsalis pedis pulse) Your capillary refill is less than 3 seconds with a strong pulse.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: Overall, based on our examination, your ankle seems to have ecchymosis present with swelling and tenderness to palpation in the anterolateral soft tissue. There is no laxity on anterior drawer or inversion stress, no bony tenderness on palpation of the foot, and your neurovascular is intact with a strong dorsalis pedis pulse and capillary refill less than 3 seconds. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have? 
Patient: No, that's all for now. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Doctor, I don't have any other symptoms. That's great to hear. So does that mean I can start walking normally again?
Doctor: While it's good news that your ankle isn't fractured, it's still important to take it easy on your ankle for a little while. We need to be careful so that your ankle heals properly.
Doctor: By the way, how's your joint pain been since our last appointment?
Patient: Actually, my left shoulder has still been bothering me quite a bit.
Doctor: Hmm, well have you been following the RICE method for your ankle sprain?
Patient: Ankle sprain? I don't remember having an ankle sprain. But my right ankle hasn't been bothering me lately.
Doctor: Have you tried doing any exercises or stretches to help with the pain?
Patient: No, I haven't had a chance to do any exercises. The pain has just been too much.
Doctor: I understand. Maybe we can start with some gentle exercises and build up from there. Would you like me to show you some easy exercises you can try at home?
Patient: That would be great, thank you.
Doctor: Okay, I'll give you some handouts with the exercises on them. And if you're still having trouble, we can schedule you for a follow-up appointment or refer you to a physical therapist.
Patient: Sounds good to me, thanks.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""It's still painful, doctor.""
Doctor: Let me check the radiographic findings from your examination. It looks like you have a right ankle sprain instead of a fracture. Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms since our last discussion?
Patient: The pain meds you gave me have helped a bit.
Doctor: That's good to hear. We can continue with that for pain control. I also recommend keeping your right leg elevated and icing your ankle regularly. Today, I'm giving you an Aircast to stabilize your ankle. You'll need to use crutches for the next 1 to 2 days and then start weight-bearing as tolerated. Do you have any questions about these treatment options?
Patient: No, that all makes sense. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: Just to confirm, you haven't noticed any changes in your symptoms recently?
Patient: No, everything seems to be the same.
Doctor: Have your symptoms improved or worsened since we last spoke? 
Patient: My symptoms have stayed the same. 
Doctor: Have you been able to play any sports or engage in physical activity?
Patient: I haven't been able to do much physical activity besides taking my medications and going to therapy appointments.
Doctor: Can you describe your current condition? Are there any factors that make it better or worse?
Patient: It's pretty stable right now. Nothing really affects it one way or the other.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you noticed any changes or worsening of your symptoms since our prior appointment? And have you been taking your medications as prescribed?
Patient: No, my symptoms are still the same. And yes, I've been following my medication regimen as instructed.
Doctor: Okay, great. When is your next scheduled follow-up visit with us?
Patient: I'm not sure, but I think it's in two weeks.

Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Have you had any of the tests I ordered done, like the Hemoglobin A1c or lipid panel?
Patient: I'm not sure, can you remind me what those are?

Doctor: Hi there, how are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm okay, just a bit worried about my chest pain.
Doctor: Yes, I understand. Based on your family history of heart disease and diabetes, it's possible that your chest pain is due to unstable angina caused by a blockage. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
Patient: No, just the chest pain.
Doctor: Okay, I want to make sure you have all the information you need. We discussed sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain last time. If the medication is not effective after approximately 5 minutes, I advise you to go to the emergency department immediately.
Patient: Alright, I understand.
Doctor: We will also start a regimen of baby aspirin at 81 mg daily and prescribe nitroglycerin up to 3 tablets every 5 minutes as needed. You will follow up with cardiology for further evaluation. Is that clear?
Patient: Yes, thank you.
Doctor: Moving on to your Type 2 diabetes, you appear to be doing well on your current regimen of metformin 500 mg twice daily and dietary modifications. 
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: However, I encourage you to keep your appointment with ophthalmology for evaluation of diabetic retinopathy. 
Patient: Okay, I'll do that.
Doctor: We'll order a repeat hemoglobin A1c to check for any necessary medication adjustments. 
Patient: Okay.
Divided:
Doctor: Lastly, we've noticed a trend of elevated blood pressures in your chart. 
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: I advise you to monitor your blood pressure at home over the next 2 weeks and report your readings to me through MyChart. 
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: This will help us determine if any adjustments need to be made to your new medication, hydrochlorothiazide. 
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: We discussed its possible side effects and how it may reduce your leg swelling seen during physical exam. Do you have any questions?
Patient: No, everything is clear. Thank you.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: So, let's talk about your medications. Have you been taking them regularly? 
Patient: Yes, I have been taking them as prescribed. 
Doctor: That's great to hear. However, I see here in your notes that you still experience chest pain sometimes. 
Patient: Yeah, that's true. I use nitroglycerin when it happens. 
Doctor: How often do you experience chest pain and how many nitroglycerin tablets do you take? 
Patient: A few times a week and usually one tablet helps. 
Doctor: Okay, we may need to adjust your medication dosage or try a different approach. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks so we can check on your progress. 
Patient: Alright, sounds good. What day and time should I come in?
Doctor: How about next Tuesday at 10am? 
Patient: That works for me. See you then! 
Doctor: Great, take care and see you next week. 
Patient: Thanks, bye!

"Doctor: Hi there, how are you feeling today? 
Patient: Hello! I am experiencing some pain in both my knees. 
Doctor: Can you describe the type of pain you are experiencing? 
Patient: It's like an ache that won't go away. 
Doctor: Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with your bilateral knee pain? 
Patient: No, just the ache in both knees.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:Yeah, I broke my arm back then.
Doctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Now, can you give me a quick overview of your medical history? Have you had any other injuries or surgeries besides the broken arm?
Patient: No, that's the only injury I've had.
Doctor: Okay, got it. Do you have any other concerns or problems with your health right now?
Patient: Well, I've been having some knee pain lately.
Doctor: I see. Is there any swelling or redness in the affected area?
Patient: Yes, actually there is.
Doctor: Alright, we'll need to take a closer look at that. 
Doctor: Have you tried any home remedies to alleviate the pain and swelling?
Patient: I've been using ice and taking over-the-counter pain medication.
Doctor: Okay, that's good to hear. I'd like to run some labs just to check on a few things.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: By the way, your previous lab results showed abnormal levels in your kidneys and thyroid. We'll need to keep an eye on that.
Patient: Oh, really? What should I do about that?
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:Yeah, sometimes it feels like they make a weird noise.
Doctor: Okay, got it. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in both of your knees? And have you had any trouble moving or bending them?
Patient: No, there's no swelling or redness. And I can still move and bend my knees just fine.
Doctor: That's good to hear. So you've been experiencing bilateral knee pain and some crepitus (crackling sounds) when you move your knees?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. Both of my knees hurt and they make this popping sound.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I haven't experienced any other symptoms.
Doctor: Alright, I just want to double check- were your vital signs within normal limits during your last visit? 
Patient: I can't remember what my vitals were last time.
Doctor: I see that all your labs were within normal limits except for a few. Have you made any changes to your diet or exercise routine lately that could potentially explain the abnormal kidney levels in your labs? 
Patient: Nope, my diet and exercise routine have been pretty consistent. 
Doctor: Alright. I noticed that all your labs came back within normal limits except for a few. Have you experienced any symptoms related to your thyroid, like feeling tired or having a fast heart rate? 
Patient: No, I haven't had any symptoms related to my thyroid. 
Doctor: How about your kidneys? Any pain or discomfort in that area lately? 
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any kidney-related symptoms either. 
Doctor: Were all your labs within normal limits during your last visit? 
Patient: Sorry, I don't really remember. 
Doctor: Have you made any recent changes to your medications or supplements that could potentially affect your lab results? 
Patient: No, I haven't changed anything recently. 
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any symptoms or changes in your health since your last visit, despite all the normal lab results? 
Patient: No, I feel pretty much the same as last time. 
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I haven't noticed anything unusual.
Doctor: Alright. Moving on, have you observed any problems with your walking or movements? 
Patient: No, my walking is normal and I don't have any issues. 
Doctor: Okay. Have you ever had any concerns or abnormalities in your gait or walking pattern before? 
Patient: No, everything has always been normal for me. I don't have any deformities present. 
Doctor: Just to confirm, your gait is normal and you don't have any deformities, right? 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. My walking is normal and there are no weird shapes or anything like that.
Doctor: Hi there! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling lately? Have you noticed any shortness of breath or chest pain?
Patient: Hey, Doc! I've been feeling pretty good actually. No trouble breathing or chest pain.
Doctor: During your last visit, did we listen to your heart with a stethoscope?
Patient: I don't remember, but I don't think so.
Doctor: Okay, no problem. Well, today I'm going to perform an auscultation of your heart to make sure everything sounds good. (Listens to patient's heart) Your heart sounds great! Regular rate and rhythm, and no murmurs. 
Patient: That's a relief to hear!
Doctor: Before you go, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet lately?
Patient: No, my ankles and feet have been fine.
Doctor: And have you noticed any unusual heart rhythms or murmurs lately?
Patient: No, nothing weird going on with my heart that I've noticed.
Doctor: Excellent. Overall, it seems like everything is looking good. Keep up the good work taking care of yourself!
Doctor: Just one more thing, have you noticed any weakness in your legs or difficulty walking?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed anything like that.
Doctor: No need to worry, I just need to check your reflexes. Can you tap your knees for me? And then I'll see how your legs react.
Patient: Sure, like this?
Doctor: Perfect. Now I'm going to check your muscle strength. Can you push against my hands with both of your legs? Let me know if you feel any discomfort or pain.
Patient: Okay, I'm pushing.
Doctor: Great job. During our last visit, we checked the symmetry of your reflexes. Have you noticed any difference in the strength or reflexes between your left and right leg?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any difference.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you experienced any recent changes in your hand or finger movements?
Patient: No, my hands and fingers feel normal to me. Is something wrong with them too?
Doctor: No, not necessarily. Can you please tap your knees again for me? I just want to check if your reflexes are the same on both legs.
Patient: Sure, here we go.
Doctor: Excellent. According to my notes, your Patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical, which is great news.
Patient: Oh, that's a relief. So everything is okay with my legs then?
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, I don't have any other symptoms.
Doctor: Let's talk about your knee pain. Have you noticed any discomfort when squatting or kneeling? 
Patient: Yeah, it hurts a bit when I squat. 
Doctor: Okay, let me examine your knees. Do you feel any tenderness or pain when I touch them? 
Patient: Yes, it hurts when you touch them. 
Doctor: Have you experienced any pain while walking or climbing stairs? 
Patient: Sometimes, yeah. 
Doctor: Let me move your knees around to check for any tenderness or pain. Have you noticed any swelling or redness on your knees? 
Patient: No, there's no swelling or redness, just pain. 
Doctor: Have you tried the McMurray test before? 
Patient: Nope, never heard of it. 
Doctor: Have you had any knee injuries recently? 
Patient: No, not that I can remember. 
Doctor: Any fluid around your knees? 
Patient: No, no fluid either. 
Doctor: Any bruises or discoloration? 
Patient: Not that I've seen. 
Doctor: Have you had a knee examination before? 
Patient: No, this is my first one. 
Doctor: Let me check for muscle weakness or numbness in your legs or knees. Do you feel anything abnormal? 
Patient: No, everything feels normal. 
Doctor: How about pain during the Lachman or drawer tests? 
Patient: I'm not sure what those are, but my knees hurt when you move them. 
Doctor: Any specific areas of tenderness when you touch your knees? 
Patient: Yeah, the sides of my knees hurt. 
Doctor: How about pain during the grind test? 
Patient: I don't know what that is, but squatting and kneeling hurt. 
Doctor: Let me focus on the Lachman test. Did you feel any pain or discomfort during that? 
Patient: I'm not sure what it is, sorry. 
Doctor: During the knee examination, did you notice any muscle weakness or tenderness to the touch in your legs or knees? 
Patient: No, everything felt normal. 
Doctor: Any positive findings during the examination, like tenderness or pain during movement? 
Patient: Yeah, my knees hurt when you moved them and there was some tenderness.

Doctor: Were there any negative findings, like lack of tenderness or absence of pain during movement? 
Patient: No, everything hurt whenever you touched or moved it. 
Doctor: And during the examination, were there any positive or negative findings related to tenderness or pain in the anterior or front part of your knees? 
Patient: Yeah, there was some tenderness and pain up there. 
Doctor: Alright, I see. Based on the examination, I have noted that there is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral retinaculum and a positive patellar grind test. You also experienced knee pain with squatting but had a negative Lachman test bilaterally. The anterior and posterior drawer tests were also negative bilaterally, as well as the McMurray test.
Doctor: Hey there! I reviewed the X-rays of your knees today. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort lately?
Patient: Nope, I haven't had any issues with my knees.
Doctor: Okay, have you ever had any knee injuries or fractures in the past?
Patient: No, I've never had any injuries or fractures on my knees.
Doctor: Has anyone in your family been diagnosed with osteoarthritis before?
Patient: What's that? I don't think anyone in my family has it.
Doctor: Based on the X-rays, there's no evidence of any fractures or osteoarthritis. Have you tried any exercises or medications to manage your knee pain?
Patient: I haven't really done anything specific for it.
Doctor: Alright, keep me updated if anything changes with your knee pain. And let me know if you have any questions or concerns about your labs, EKG, knee pain, or medication.
Patient: Will do, thank you!
Doctor: Hi there, how's it going? I see in your notes that you've been experiencing knee pain. Can you tell me more about it?
Patient: Yeah, it's been bothering me for a while now. It hurts when I bend my knees or go up stairs.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. How often do you experience this knee pain?
Patient: Pretty much all the time, especially when I'm doing activities like squatting or kneeling.
Doctor: Ah, I see. And how long have you been dealing with this knee pain?
Patient: It's been a few months now.
Doctor: It sounds like you may have patellofemoral pain syndrome in both knees. Have you tried any home remedies or exercises to manage your knee pain?
Patient: No, not yet.
Doctor: Well, there are some exercises that can help alleviate the pain associated with patellofemoral pain syndrome. Would you be willing to try them out?
Patient: Sure, I'm open to anything that might help.
Doctor: Great. I'll provide you with some exercises to try at home. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to assess your progress and discuss other treatment options if needed. Sound good?
Patient: Yes, thank you so much. Is there anything else I should know about these exercises?
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, just the knee pain.
Doctor: Okay, before we wrap up today's examination, can you tell me if you have noticed any swelling or redness in your knee?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any swelling or redness in my knee.
Doctor: After reviewing your radiographic findings, we need to have a discussion about the best treatment options for your knee. It looks like you have patellofemoral pain syndrome. We may need to consider physical therapy, injections or even surgery. Do you understand?
Patient: Yes, I understand.
Doctor: How has your mobility been affected by the knee pain and other symptoms? 
Patient: My knee hurts a lot when I try to walk or climb stairs. It's hard to move around.
Doctor: Have you found any treatments that have helped alleviate your knee pain? And have you been able to do any exercises or stretches that have made it feel better?
Patient: No, nothing has really helped so far.
Doctor: Have you attempted any at-home remedies or treatments to help alleviate your knee pain and make running or walking easier?
Patient: I've tried icing it and elevating my leg, but it hasn't made much of a difference.
Doctor: Have you been wearing the correct shoes when running to make it easier on your knee?
Patient: I don't really know if my shoes are the right kind for running, but I will definitely look into it.
Doctor: How has your overall mood been since experiencing knee pain? Have you noticed any changes in your emotions or behavior?
Patient: I've been feeling kind of down and frustrated that I can't do normal activities because of the pain.
Doctor: Based on your examination and symptoms, I think physical therapy is a good option for you. It will increase your lower extremity strength, mobility, and correct any incorrect running mechanics. I also encourage you to take it easy on running for now. You can continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatories as needed for pain. All questions were answered. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
Patient: No, that's all. Thank you, Doc.
Doctor: Before we wrap up, can I schedule your follow-up appointment?
Patient: Of course. I'm available for a follow-up next week on Wednesday or Thursday. I have other appointments on Monday and Tuesday, and I work all day on Friday.
Doctor: Got it. Let's pencil in next week's follow-up for Wednesday then. I'll send over the details.
Patient: Sounds good to me. Thank you.

"Doctor: Hi there, Kyle! How's it going today?
Patient: Hey doc! I'm doing alright.

Patient: I haven't been monitoring it at home, but I have noticed high readings during appointments.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""Well, sometimes my heart feels like it's beating really fast and I struggle to catch my breath. I also experience chest pain from time to time. I do take medication for my blood pressure, but I haven't had any allergic reactions to it.""
Doctor: Have you been monitoring your blood pressure regularly?
Patient: My blood pressure has been okay.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your respiratory rate or heart symptoms since starting the medication?

Patient: No, I haven't had any of those issues.
Doctor: Have you had any trouble with breathing?
Patient: Yes, sometimes I feel like I can't breathe well and it's uncomfortable.
Doctor: I understand. Let's focus on your breathing and discomfort for now. Have you noticed any changes or concerns with that? We'll definitely look into it further, but first we need to address your kidney and thyroid levels. Do you remember anything about your recent labs showing any issues with them?
Doctor: Before we talk about anything else, I just want to check on something. Your notes say that your sensation and reflexes are normal. Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
Doctor: I noticed that your notes indicate normal sensation and symmetrical patellar and Achilles reflexes. Have you experienced any symptoms lately related to these areas?
Doctor: Based on your notes, it looks like your muscles and movements are normal and symmetrical, including your patellar and Achilles reflexes. Is there anything specific you want to discuss regarding this?
Doctor: Your notes show normal sensation and symmetrical reflexes, which is great news. Have you noticed any changes in how you feel or any concerns with your health lately?

Doctor: Any other symptons?
Doctor, can you tell me what's in the MRI report? I had no idea about it.
Doctor: According to the MRI results, it seems like you have a disc bulge and stenosis that is causing pressure on your nerves in the lower back which may be the reason for the discomfort.
Patient: Did the MRI show any evidence of stenosis on the right side?
Doctor: Yes, the MRI shows moderate neural foraminal stenosis on the right side. Are you experiencing numbness or tingling sensations in your legs or feet?
Patient: Yes, I am feeling some numbness in my legs.
Doctor: That could be due to nerve compression in your lower back caused by the stenosis. Did you notice any specific issues or concerns on the right side during the examination or MRI?
Patient: To be honest, I don't remember anything specific on the right side. The only thing I know is that the MRI showed disc bulge, stenosis, and right-sided symptoms.
Doctor: Alright, got it. Have you observed any changes in your bowel or bladder movements?
Patient: No, nothing like that.
Doctor: Okay, have you tried any medication or treatments for your lower back pain?
Patient: Yes, I have been taking medications for a while now.
Doctor: How are they working for you?

Doctor: Understood. Any side effects from these medications?
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any side effects so far.
Doctor: Were you referred to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment?
Patient: Yes, my doctor referred me to a specialist who prescribed physical therapy or maybe surgery.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms since starting the treatment?
Patient: It's too early to say, but I hope it will help me.
Doctor: Has the specialist recommended any specific exercises or stretches for your lower back?
Patient: Yes, they provided me with some exercises to do at home.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement in mobility or daily activities since starting the exercises?

Patient: Hello doctor, I'm not feeling very well.
Doctor: I see that you're here for an evaluation of your left knee pain. Can you tell me more about it?
Patient: Yes, I fell while running with my niece a week ago and twisted my knee. Since then, I've been limping and the pain has been increasing.
Doctor: Where exactly is the pain located in your knee?
Patient: It's on the medial and lateral aspects of my knee.
Doctor: On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your current pain level?
Patient: It was a 4 before, but now it's around an 8. The pain is throbbing.

Patient: They haven't been that effective, unfortunately.
Doctor: Are you able to take ibuprofen for pain relief?
Patient: No, I have an ulcer so I can't take it.
Doctor: Have you attended physical therapy sessions for pain relief?
Patient: Not yet, but I'm willing to try it.
Doctor: On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate the effectiveness of pain relief methods you've tried so far?

Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:No, those are the only symptoms I've been experiencing.
Doctor: During the examination, did you notice any swelling or fluid buildup around your knee?
Patient: Yeah, my knee looked puffy and felt like there was extra fluid in there. It was uncomfortable.
Doctor: Did we perform a valgus and varus stress test on your knee during the examination?
Patient: I'm not sure what that means.
Doctor: Did we find any negative results during the examination, such as no signs of swelling or edema in the knee area?
Patient: Unfortunately, no. There was definitely some swelling around my knee, and it hurt when you moved it.
Doctor: Did we discover any other injuries or inflammation besides the edema and pain in your knee?
Patient: No, you just focused on examining my knee and asked about the pain.
Doctor: Were there any positive findings during the examination, like signs of injury or inflammation beyond the swelling and pain in your knee?
Patient: Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by positive findings.

Patient: No, the doctor said my lab results were mostly normal except for my kidney and thyroid levels.
Doctor: Okay, good to know. Now, during our examination of your knee, did we notice any improvement in the swelling?

Doctor: I see. And have you noticed any improvement in the swelling since your last visit?
Patient: No, I don't think the swelling has improved much since then.
Doctor: Alright, thank you for letting me know. Lastly, do you have a history of any fractures, dislocations or abnormalities in any other parts of your body?

Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""It's been hurting a bit lately.""
Doctor: Have you noticed any specific movements or activities that make the pain worse?

Doctor: That could be a possible cause of the pain. Another possibility is a muscle strain. 
Patient: What does a muscle strain mean?
Doctor: A muscle strain happens when a muscle is stretched too far and tears. Do you recall overexerting yourself or doing anything strenuous that may have caused a muscle strain in your knee? 
Patient: Actually, now that you mention it, I did play pretty hard during that basketball game.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient:""It's been okay, but I still have some pain.""
Doctor: After reviewing your x-rays and examination, I noticed that there are no signs of tear on your knee. We can try conservative treatment by using a knee immobilizer for increased support. I've also prescribed tramadol 50 mg to alleviate your pain, and Tylenol for any breakthrough pain. Have you been taking them as instructed?
Patient: Yes, I have.
Doctor: How often do you use ice to reduce swelling and pain?
Patient: I've been trying to use it every few hours as you suggested, but sometimes I forget.
Doctor: That's alright. Have you seen any improvement in your pain since using the knee immobilizer regularly?
Patient: Not really, the pain is still there.
Doctor: Have you been running while wearing the immobilizer?
Patient: No, I haven't been running at all.
Doctor: How often have you been using the immobilizer?
Patient: I wear it all the time, except when I take a shower or go to bed.
Doctor: Since wearing the immobilizer, have you noticed any improvement in your pain?
Patient: Not really, the pain is still there.
Doctor: How often have you experienced breakthrough pain while wearing the immobilizer?
Patient: Sometimes, but not too often.
Doctor: Have you been wearing the immobilizer as instructed, four times a day for at least two hours?
Patient: Yes, I've been doing my best.
Doctor: And have you noticed any improvement in pain since increasing the use of the immobilizer to four times a day for at least two hours?
Patient: No, the pain is still there even with the increased use.
Doctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Have you seen any improvement in your pain since the examination and starting to use the immobilizer?
Patient: No, the pain is still there.
Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any improvement in your pain since using the immobilizer four times a day?
Patient: No, the pain is still there even with using it four times a day.
Doctor: And have you been consistently wearing the immobilizer four times a day as instructed?
Patient: Yes, I have.
Doctor: I understand. How has the immobilizer been working for you? Any improvements seen?
Patient: It's okay, but it hasn't really helped with the pain.
Doctor: Alright. Have you noticed any improvement in your pain since increasing the use of the immobilizer to four times a day for at least two hours?
Patient: No, the pain is still there even with the increased use.
