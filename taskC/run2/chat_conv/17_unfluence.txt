Doctor: Hi Jacqueline, how are you feeling today? Let's start by talking about your perioral dermatitis. Have you been using doxycycline as prescribed?
Patient: Yes, I've been applying it twice daily as instructed by the doctor. I haven't noticed any changes yet.
Doctor: That's good to hear. We want to make sure we reach full resolution before reducing the application to once a day. Are you planning to resume using Elidel?
Patient: No, I can't afford it without insurance.
Doctor: Alright, no problem. I'll prescribe Tacrolimus instead. Just be aware of any possible side effects while using the medication.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: And continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.
Patient: Understood.
Doctor: It seems that your skin around the mouth area is still bothering you. Based on your symptoms, it could be an allergic reaction or a bacterial infection. I'm prescribing a topical antibiotic cream for you.
Patient: How often should I use the cream?
Doctor: Use it twice a day for two weeks. We can schedule a follow-up visit to see how it's doing.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Now, let's move on to your rosacea, including ocular rosacea. How has MetroCream been working for you?
Patient: It's been helping a bit, but not as much as I'd like.
Doctor: Have you been following the recommended regime?
Patient: Yes, I have.
Doctor: Good to know. I recommend gently washing your eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and trying a gentle cream like Vanicream.
Patient: I'll give that a try.
Doctor: By the way, have you had any difficulty breathing or shortness of breath lately?
Patient: No, I can breathe fine. But I've been having a lot of stomach problems.
Doctor: Can you describe your stomach problems?
Patient: Sometimes I feel really nauseous and don't want to eat anything, but other times I'm really hungry.
Doctor: And have you had any headaches, dizziness, or blurred vision recently?
Patient: Yes, I've been getting these really bad headaches and sometimes my vision gets all blurry.
Doctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Let's check if there are any underlying issues that might be causing these problems. Can you come back next week for some tests and a follow-up on your perioral dermatitis?
Patient: Sure, I can do that.
Doctor: Also, based on your oily skin and occasional pimples, I recommend using a gentle cleanser and oil-free moisturizer twice a day.
Patient: Should I continue using the Doxycycline cream and Sulfacetamide wash?
Doctor: Yes, use Doxycycline cream twice daily, apply MetroCream as directed, and use Sulfacetamide wash topically twice daily. These will help to address any acne or oiliness concerns you have.
Doctor: Additionally, did you experience any side effects from the Tylenol with codeine such as drowsiness or difficulty concentrating?
Patient: Yeah, I feel really sleepy and kind of out of it. But my head still hurts.
Doctor: Okay. Have you been able to keep any food or liquids down, or have you been experiencing vomiting along with the nausea and headache?
Patient: I've been able to keep some food down, but not a lot. And I haven't thrown up yet, but I feel like I might.
Doctor: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your sensitivity to light or nausea since taking the medication and resting for a day?
Patient: The medicine is helping a little bit with the pain, but I still feel sensitive to light and nauseous.
Doctor: Understood. Let's schedule some tests and a follow-up visit to get to the bottom of your symptoms. If you experience any side effects from the medications or any new symptoms, give us a call. See you next week for our follow-up visit.
Doctor: Oh, one more thing - can you tell me about your immunization history? Have you received any shots in the last year?
Patient: I don't remember getting any shots recently, so I'm not sure.
Doctor: Alright. Have you experienced any symptoms or illnesses since your last visit?
Patient: Yeah, I had a cold a few weeks ago and my nose was stuffy, but it went away on its own. Other than that, I've been feeling pretty good.
Doctor: Thanks for letting me know. Lastly, you mentioned you have been experiencing fatigue and weakness, weight loss, and loss of appetite. In addition, you mentioned headaches and blurry vision. Let's dive deeper into those symptoms during our follow-up visit next week.
Patient: That sounds like a good plan.
Doctor: Can you also tell me if any imaging tests were ordered or mentioned during your appointment?
Patient: I don't think so, Doc. You didn't mention any imaging tests during my appointment.
Doctor: Okay, that's fine. Now, can you tell me about your gynecologic history, such as any surgeries or past issues?
Patient: Oh sure. I have never had any surgeries or issues with my lady parts. Everything has been normal for me in that area.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Can you describe your menstrual cycle? How long are your periods and how often do they come?
Patient: Well, it's been a while since I've had my period. They used to come every month but now they hardly ever come.
Doctor: I see. How long has it been since your last period?
Patient: Honestly, I can't even remember. It's been a while.
Doctor: Okay, no problem. Let's address your current symptoms first and then we can take a closer look at your menstrual cycle and any related issues during our follow-up visit.
Patient: Sounds good to me, Doctor.
Doctor: Have you ever experienced any allergic reactions in the past?
Patient: No, I haven't had any allergic reactions before.
Doctor: What is your past medical history? Have you had any health issues in the past?
Patient: Nope, never had any other medical history.
Doctor: Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, had surgeries or hospitalizations, or taken any long-term medications in the past?
Patient: No, I've never had any of those before.
Doctor: How's everything going with your symptoms?
Patient: They've been getting worse lately.
Doctor: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. When did you start noticing the worsening symptoms?
Patient: It's been about a week or so now.
Doctor: Have you been taking your medication as prescribed? Any side effects?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking it regularly. Sometimes it makes me feel a little nauseous, but nothing too serious.
Doctor: Alright, we may need to adjust your medication dosage or try a different type. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check on your progress. And if anything changes or gets worse before then, please don't hesitate to call the clinic.
