Doctor: Hi there, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Hello, I've been experiencing pain in my right knee for about 2.5 weeks now.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me how it started?
Patient: It started after I stepped off a curb and turned my ankle.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Now, can you tell me about the strain you experienced while playing basketball?
Patient: I was playing basketball with my friends when suddenly I felt a sharp pain in my right knee. After that, it started to swell up and hurt whenever I put pressure on it.
Doctor: I see. Let's first focus on your knee pain. I'd like to order an X-ray to determine if there's any damage to the joint.
Patient: Alright, that sounds like a good idea.
Doctor: As for the strain, we'll do a physical exam and possibly an MRI to assess the extent of the injury.
Patient: What kind of treatment options are there?
Doctor: Treatment options could include physical therapy or possibly surgery if necessary.
Patient: In the meantime, what should I do to manage the pain?
Doctor: Continue taking pain medication and avoid activities that exacerbate the pain.
Patient: Okay, I'll do that. Is there anything else I should keep in mind?
Doctor: Yes, proper footwear is important for preventing further injury.

Doctor: Can you tell me about your work and exercise routine?
Patient: I work in sales and I ride a bike for exercise.
Doctor: It's important to maintain a healthy balance between work and exercise. Make sure to wear appropriate shoes while exercising to support your feet and knees.
Patient: I'll make sure to wear proper shoes. Thanks for the advice.

Doctor: How's your knee feeling these days?
Patient: It's still hurting, doc. But I've been taking the meloxicam you prescribed me and doing the physical therapy exercises like you suggested.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you noticed any improvement in your pain since starting the meloxicam?
Patient: Yeah, I think it's helping a bit. The pain isn't as bad as before.
Doctor: Great! How often have you been taking the meloxicam?
Patient: I've been taking it every day like you said.
Doctor: Have you experienced any side effects from the meloxicam?
Patient: Besides some upset stomach sometimes, I haven't had any other side effects.
Doctor: That's good to know. On a scale from 1 to 10, how severe would you say your knee pain is now?
Patient: I'd say it's around a 5 right now. It still bothers me, but not as much as before.
Doctor: Have you been able to do your daily activities without any problems?
Patient: I've been able to do my daily activities without too much difficulty.
Doctor: Alright. If the pain doesn't improve with physical therapy and medication, we may need to do an MRI to see what's going on.
Patient: And if we need to do that, when should we schedule it?
Doctor: Let's continue with the conservative treatment for now and see how it goes. We can reassess the need for an MRI in a few weeks.
Patient: Sounds good to me, doc.
