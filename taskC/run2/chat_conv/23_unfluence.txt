Doctor: Hey there, how are you feeling today? I see you've been experiencing right elbow pain. Can you describe it?
Patient: It hurts when I move my arm or lift things. It feels like a sharp pain sometimes and a dull ache at other times.
Doctor: It could be medial epicondylitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Have you had any recent elbow injuries?
Patient: No, I haven't had any recent injuries or accidents.
Doctor: I'll recommend rest, ice, and physical therapy for your elbow pain. Does that sound good?
Patient: Yes, that sounds good. Thanks for your help. How's my blood pressure and diabetes type 2?
Doctor: My blood pressure has been high and fluctuating. I'm on Lisinopril 10 mg, and Metformin 500 mg twice daily for diabetes. Any blood pressure-related symptoms?
Patient: I get headaches when my blood pressure spikes.
Doctor: We'll monitor your blood pressure closely and adjust medication if necessary. Let's schedule physical therapy for your elbow pain. When did you start experiencing pain in your right forearm and wrist?
Patient: A few days ago, it just came out of nowhere.
Doctor: Have you had any recent trauma or injury to your right forearm and wrist?
Patient: No, I haven't had any recent injuries or accidents.
Doctor: We'll try rest, ice, and physical therapy exercises for your forearm and wrist. Any sinus tachycardia symptoms?
Patient: No, just a faster heart rate.
Doctor: Have you made any changes to your daily routine, diet, or stress levels?
Patient: I've been eating healthier and managing stress better, but I don't think those changes would cause this.
Doctor: We'll keep monitoring your heart rate, blood pressure, and diabetes. How's the treatment for your medial epicondylitis going?
Patient: It's okay. I wear the sling, ice my elbow twice a day, and take ibuprofen.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvements in pain or range of motion?
Patient: The pain is not as bad, and I can move my arm more easily now.
Doctor: Any side effects from the ibuprofen or other medications?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed anything.
Doctor: Have you scheduled appointments with Siskin Rehab Hospital yet?
Patient: No, the patient coordinator is supposed to call me within two days.
Doctor: Make sure to schedule those appointments. We'll also increase your metformin dosage. How do you feel about that?
Patient: I'll do whatever it takes to manage my diabetes.
Doctor: We'll follow up in two weeks to review your hemoglobin A1c test and progress. Keep up with the prescribed treatment plan.
Patient: Will do, thanks for all your help.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have concerns or questions before our follow-up, reach out. Take care!
