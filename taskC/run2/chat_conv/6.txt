Doctor: Hi there! How have you been feeling since your last visit? I also wanted to follow up on your lab results. Your labs showed abnormal levels for Sodium and Creatinine, which are related to your kidneys. Your thyroid levels were also not normal.
Can you describe any symptoms that you've been experiencing that may be related to these abnormal lab results?
Patient: Honestly, I haven't really been feeling any different, but maybe that's because I didn't know about these lab results until now.
Doctor: Okay, it's good that you're not experiencing any symptoms. Moving on, did anything happen before the fatigue, swollen elbow joints, bullseye rash, body aches, and nausea started? Any insect bites or hiking in the woods recently?
Patient: Yes, I had an insect bite after hiking in the woods. We did a Lyme titer test, and it came back positive for Lyme disease.
Doctor: Have you experienced any high fevers, fatigue, or joint pain from the Lyme disease? And have you started taking antibiotics as prescribed?
Patient: No, I haven't had high fevers or joint pain, but my fatigue is pretty bad. I have started taking the antibiotics as prescribed.
Doctor: That's good to hear. It's important to take the full course of antibiotics as directed and follow up with us if you have any concerns. Let me know if you experience any side effects or improvements in your fatigue.
Regarding your diabetes and hypertension, it's great to hear that your blood sugars have been okay, and you're still taking metformin. Your blood pressure has been good, and you're avoiding salty foods and still taking lisinopril. Are you experiencing any abdominal pain or diarrhea?
Patient: No, I'm not having any abdominal pain or diarrhea.
Doctor: Excellent. What is the treatment plan for the patient's positive Lyme titer?
Patient: Doctor, you already started me on doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks to treat the infection caused by Lyme disease.
Doctor: Good! How frequently have you been taking the doxycycline medication for your Lyme disease since we last spoke?
Patient: I've been taking the doxycycline twice a day, every day since you prescribed it.
Doctor: Can you tell me if you have been experiencing any symptoms related to your kidneys or thyroid since we last spoke about your abnormal lab results?
Patient: I don't think so, Doctor. I haven't noticed anything different or unusual with my kidneys or thyroid.
Doctor: Great. Moving on to your hypertension, how has your blood pressure been at home?
Patient: It's been well-controlled, thanks to the dietary modifications I've made to limit my sodium intake.
Doctor: That's excellent news. Regarding your diabetes type 2, have you been having any issues with nausea due to the medication or diet restrictions?
Patient: Yes, I've had some nausea because of the Lyme disease, but I've been compliant with the use of metformin and following the recommended diet.
Doctor: Okay. Lastly, let me prescribe something to help with your sore throat and hoarseness. Please keep taking your medications as prescribed and make sure to follow up with us if you have any concerns or questions. By the way, how are you currently managing your diabetes and hypertension?
Patient: I'm still taking medication and making some lifestyle changes like eating healthier and exercising regularly to manage both my diabetes and high blood pressure.
Doctor: Keep it up, and we'll continue to monitor your progress during our future appointments. Also, we'll keep an eye on your kidney function and thyroid levels and adjust your treatment plan accordingly.
