For example:

Doctor: It looks like your white blood cell count is normal according to your most recent labs. But, I do want to keep an eye on it given your history of high white blood cells. 
Patient: That's good to hear. I'm glad that it's back to normal. 
Patient: However, I must say that I've been having a lot of pain over the past several days. 
Doctor: Where's the pain located? 
Patient: It's mainly my left shoulder and lower back. 
Doctor: Oh, I see. Have you been taking anything for the pain? I remember you were having problems with your lower back the last time you were here. Did you get a chance to see the orthopedist? I believe the left shoulder pain could be due to impingement syndrome. 
Patient: No, I haven't taken anything for it yet and I forgot to make an appointment with the doc you recommended. I've been smoking cigs to help with the pain. 
Doctor: I'd advise that you try to wean off smoking for now and consider looking into nicotine patches. Let me see what I can do for the pain and if we can schedule you to see an orthopedist. 
Patient: Thanks, doc. I've had a lot of trouble weaning off cigs for a while now. I've also been eating pretty bad, too. I got to do better.
Doctor: It'll take time, but with the right diet and regimen, you'll be on better track towards attaining a healthy weight and lifestyle. 
Patient: Oh, and before I forget-
Doctor: Yes? 
Patient: I seem to be peeing a lot more these days. 
Doctor: Are you experiencing any other urinary symptoms? 
Patient: No, nothing else. 
Doctor: I'll order a urine sample for today's visit to see if you have an infection.
Patient: Thank you, doc. And before you write the order, do you know why my one leg is more swollen than the other? 
Doctor: Let me take a look.
