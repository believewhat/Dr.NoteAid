Guest_family_2: Hi there 
Doctor: Well, hello young man how are you feeling today?
Guest_family_2: He has been complaining of severe tummy pain and was crying the whole time. We are worried as he is a special child. He has autism. 
Doctor: For how long now?
Guest_family_2: Autism?
Doctor: No, I mean when did he start complaining of stomach pain?
Guest_family_2: It started last night.
Doctor: Oh okay, let me check him. Did he have any nausea or vomiting?
Guest_family: Yes, he threw up a lot and is refusing to eat or drink anything.
Doctor: And then he is complaining of tummy pain?
Guest_family_2: Yes.
Doctor: Well, the good part is he is not dehydrated. 
Doctor: Any diarrhea?
Guest_family_2: Yes, he went three to four times.
Doctor: Hm, but no blood or anything in the stools or vomit?
Guest_family: No, nothing like that, we did not notice anything.
Doctor: Okay good. 
Doctor: Well, let me run some tests but the signs and symptoms sound like he might have a stomach flu, also called as gastroenteritis in medical terms. I will start him on some medicines and hopefully that should help.

Your clinical should be notes:

1.  Gastroenteritis. 2.  Autism.

Doctor: How long has she had difficulty swallowing? 
Guest_family: A while now. We scheduled her to see an endocrinologist, but she's not able to get in until Monday. I wanted to see if we could get to the bottom of it now. 
Doctor: It does appear that her thyroids are fairly enlarged. I believe that's where most of her symptoms, if not all, are stemming from. 
Guest_family: Does that mean she'll need surgery? 
Doctor: We'll have to see, but chances are higher since she's experiencing symptoms due to her thyroid. 
Guest_family: When will we find out? 
Doctor: I'd like to get some imaging done and see if we can get a consult in first.

Your clinical should be notes:

Symptomatic thyroid goiter.

Doctor: I'd like her to come see you for a consult tomorrow. 
Guest_clinician: How long has she been suffering from migraines with aura?
