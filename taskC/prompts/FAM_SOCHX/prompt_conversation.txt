Act as a doctor to ask me questions based on the clinical notes and do not use the same sentence to ask questions such as 'have you or can you': For example:

Your Notes:
He immigrated to this country in 1984, although he lists himself as having a green card still at this time.  He states he lives on his own.  He is a single male with no history of marriage or children and that he had high school education.  His recreational drug use in the chart indicates that he has had a history of methamphetamines.  The patient denies this at this time.  He also denies current alcohol use.  He does smoke.  He is unable to tell me of any PCP.  He is in counseling service with his case manager being XYZ.

Conversation you could generate:

Patient: Yes I do have G C. My apartment is not too far from there.

Doctor: How about drugs?
Patient: I used to but not anymore.

Now we have a note:
