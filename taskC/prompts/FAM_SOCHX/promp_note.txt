Doctor: I'd like to know more about your family's medical history. 
Patient: Buckle up. This is a long one. My son is fifty eight and he suffers from glaucoma, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and R A. My eldest brother passed away at ninety two due to old age and my two younger brothers followed in their seventies after a long battle with Parkinson disease. 
Doctor: I'm incredibly sorry to hear that. 
Patient: It's alright. Both my mom and dad died in their mid eighties from old age. I think my dad was eighty five and my mom eighty nine.
