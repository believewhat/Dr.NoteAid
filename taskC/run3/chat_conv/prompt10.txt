Doctor: Hi there! How are you doing today? I remember we talked about your asthma and allergies last time, how have they been since then?
Patient: Actually, I've been struggling with my asthma and allergies lately. I've had some asthma attacks and my allergies have been bothering me almost every day.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's talk about your asthma medication first. Are you taking it regularly?
Patient: I try to take my inhaler as prescribed, but sometimes I forget.
Doctor: It's important to be consistent with your medication. Now, how about your allergies? Are you avoiding known triggers like peanuts and tree nuts?
Patient: Yes, I make sure to avoid peanuts and tree nuts as much as possible.
Doctor: That's good. Have you noticed any specific triggers for your other allergies or reactions besides peanuts?
Patient: Not really, they seem to happen randomly. But peanuts always cause a reaction for me.
Doctor: I see. Have you ever been prescribed Montelukast sodium for your allergies?
Patient: Yes, I have. But I experienced a "seizure-like" reaction to it and had to stop taking it.
Doctor: That's concerning. Have you ever been hospitalized for your peanut allergy before?
Patient: Yes, I've been to the hospital a few times because of my peanut allergy. It's really scary when it happens.
Doctor: It's important to be prepared for emergencies. Do you always carry an epinephrine auto-injector with you?
Patient: Yes, I always carry an epinephrine auto-injector with me in case of a severe reaction to peanuts. My doctor told me to.
Doctor: Great, keep carrying it with you at all times. Now, let's talk about the rash on your arm. Have you had any recent travel or exposure to new substances that might have caused it?
Patient: No, nothing out of the ordinary. I haven't had any recent travel or exposure to new substances, and I haven't changed my hygiene routine or used any new personal care products.
Doctor: Okay, we'll take a closer look at it later. In the meantime, let's focus on managing your asthma and allergies. Have you been experiencing any breathing difficulties or chest tightness lately?
Patient: Yeah, I still feel a bit of difficulty breathing sometimes, but it's not as bad as before.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Are you taking your Wixela Inhub and Alvesco medications as prescribed?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking them every day like you told me to.
Doctor: Great. Have you noticed any triggers that seem to worsen your breathing difficulties?
Patient: It seems to get worse when I'm doing intense exercise or around smoke or strong smells.
Doctor: Try to avoid those triggers as much as possible. Now, let's discuss your asthma history. Have you noticed any triggers for your asthma symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, whenever I'm around smoke or dust, my breathing gets really bad. It's hard for me to catch my breath.
Doctor: Have you been avoiding smoke and dust as much as possible?
Patient: Yeah, I try to stay away from them as much as I can. But sometimes it's hard, especially when I'm outside or around other people who smoke.
Doctor: I understand. Have you tried using a rescue inhaler during these episodes?
Patient: Yeah, I have. It helps a little bit, but I still feel like I'm struggling to breathe.
Doctor: We could consider using a daily maintenance inhaler to help prevent asthma symptoms. What do you think?
Patient: I haven't thought about that. What does it do?
Doctor: It reduces inflammation in your airways, which can make your asthma symptoms less severe and frequent. Given your history of moderate persistent asthma, it may be worth considering. Now, let's talk about your peanut allergy. Have you been avoiding peanuts since your anaphylactic reaction?
Patient: Yes, I have. I've been really careful to read food labels and avoid anything with peanuts in it.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Do you also experience allergic rhinitis, or nasal allergies?
Patient: Yes, I do. My nose gets really stuffy and runny, especially in the spring and fall.
Doctor: We'll want to keep an eye on that as well. In the meantime, let's discuss the possibility of starting a maintenance inhaler for your asthma. Moving on, I understand you have aspirations to join the military. Can you tell me more about that and how your asthma may affect that goal?
Patient: Yeah, I really want to join the military but I heard they have physical fitness requirements that I need to meet without using my inhaler. So that's been on my mind.
Doctor: Have you discussed your aspirations to join the military with your primary care physician?
Patient: No, I haven't talked to my doctor about it yet.
Doctor: It may be a good idea to schedule an appointment with them to discuss this further and undergo pulmonary function tests to assess your lung function. This can help determine whether alternative treatment options or accommodations may be necessary to help you achieve your goals while still managing your asthma effectively.
Patient: Thanks for the advice, doc. And thank you for checking out my rash too.
