Doctor: Hi Susan, how are you feeling today? Have you been checking your blood pressure regularly?
Patient: I'm okay, just a little worried about my blood pressure. Yeah, I've been monitoring it and it's been consistently high.
Doctor: That is concerning. Can you tell me more about your recent struggles with high blood pressure?
Patient: Well, it's always been a problem for me, but lately it seems out of control. My blood pressure at home has been over 150. I've had some headaches, but I'm not sure if it's from stress at work or the high blood pressure.
Doctor: Okay. Let's talk about your medication. What are you currently taking for your high blood pressure?
Patient: I'm taking Norvasc 10 mg daily. I've been taking it for a while now, maybe a year or so. And I haven't really noticed any side effects.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Do you feel like Norvasc has been effective in controlling your high blood pressure?
Patient: It was working well before, but lately it hasn't been doing enough. Yes, I would like to explore my options.
Doctor: Great. Considering your medical history, including your kidney transplant, we will need to be careful when selecting a new medication. We can also discuss some diet changes that may help. Let's work together to find the best solution for your high blood pressure. On another note, have you been experiencing any chest pain or shortness of breath lately?
Patient: No, I haven't had any chest pain or trouble breathing.
Doctor: How often have you been having headaches and where do you feel the pain specifically?
Patient: I get them a few times a week and the pain is usually in my forehead or on the sides of my head.
Doctor: Have you noticed any triggers for your headaches, such as stress or certain foods?
Patient: I don't really know. Maybe stress? I've been feeling pretty anxious lately.
Doctor: That could be a possible trigger. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble falling asleep lately and I wake up a lot during the night.
Doctor: Do you experience any nausea or vomiting with your headaches?
Patient: No, I haven't felt sick to my stomach.
Doctor: How about changes in your vision or sensitivity to light during your headaches?
Patient: Yes, sometimes the light bothers me when I have a headache. And my vision gets blurry sometimes too.
Doctor: Have you tried taking over-the-counter pain relievers for your headaches and have they been effective?
Patient: Yeah, I've tried ibuprofen but it only helps a little bit.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, it sounds like you may be experiencing migraines. Have you ever been diagnosed with them before?
Patient: No, I've never been diagnosed with anything like that.
Doctor: Okay, we can look into that further. And just to make sure, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
Patient: Not really, my appetite seems okay and I haven't noticed any changes in my weight.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about the scar on your left flank?
Patient: Oh, that's from a kidney transplant I had a few years ago.
Doctor: I see. How has your recovery been since the transplant?
Patient: It's been great, doctor. No issues at all.
Doctor: That's good to hear. During my examination, I didn't notice any swelling or edema in your limbs. Have you noticed any swelling or fluid retention lately?
Patient: No, everything seems normal to me.
Doctor: That's great. Moving on to your respiratory system, I didn't hear any wheezes, rales, or rhonchi during auscultation. Have you experienced any shortness of breath or difficulty breathing lately?
Patient: No, my breathing feels fine.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Now, regarding your cardiovascular system, during my examination, I heard a systolic ejection murmur. Can you describe any symptoms you may have been having that could be related to this?
Patient: What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: It means that there is an abnormal sound in your heart when it beats. Have you experienced any chest pain or shortness of breath recently?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed anything weird with my heart or breathing.
Doctor: That's good. Lastly, during my examination, I checked your neck for any signs of thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy and found none. Have you noticed any lumps or swelling in your neck recently?
Patient: No, everything seems normal.
Doctor: Great. Thank you for answering my questions thoroughly. Also, I noticed that your creatinine levels are normal now. Have you experienced any improvement in your kidney function symptoms since the last test?
Patient: Actually, I didn't have any kidney-related symptoms before, so I haven't noticed any changes. But it's reassuring to know that my levels are normal.
Doctor: That's good to hear. How about your heart rate? The previous EKG showed a higher heart rate of 122. Have you noticed any changes in your heartbeat or any symptoms related to your heart?
Patient: No, I haven't felt any symptoms related to my heart. I haven't really been paying attention to my heartbeat though.
Doctor: Okay, well based on your current electrocardiogram, your heart rate is normal. That's good news. Is there anything else you want to discuss today?
Patient: No, that covers everything for me. Thank you for checking in and providing updates on my test results.
