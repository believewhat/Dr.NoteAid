Doctor: Hey there, it's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since your shunt surgery for hydrocephalus?
Patient: I've been feeling okay since the surgery, thanks for asking.
Doctor: That's good to hear. How about Mr. Watson, how has he been doing since his shunt surgery in August 2020?
Patient: My dad has been doing pretty well too. He's been feeling better and his headaches have gone down a bit.
Doctor: Great progress for both of you. Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms since the surgery, such as gait impairment or urinary incontinence?
Patient: Well, I don't feel as much pressure in my head anymore and my headaches have decreased. However, I still have some walking impairment and urinary incontinence.

Doctor: And how about Mr. Watson? Any changes in his symptoms or overall health since his surgery, including his walking and bladder control?
Patient: My dad hasn't had any major issues since his surgery. He can walk to the dining room now, and his balance has improved. As for his bladder control, there was initial improvement, but he still wears a diaper. His thinking has improved as well.

Doctor: That's reassuring. How has Mr. Watson been coping with his cognitive impairment? Has he been experiencing any anxiety or stress related to it?
Patient: Yes, he's been feeling more anxious and stressed lately because of his cognitive difficulties.

Doctor: I see. Based on the CT scan Mr. Watson had on 10/15/2020, there's a tiny amount of blood in his right frontal region and some small vessel ischemic change. We will schedule some tests and appointments to investigate his cognitive and walking issues, as well as the small vessel ischemic change. In the meantime, let's discuss his medications. Is Mr. Watson taking any medications right now?
Patient: Yes, he's taking Xanax for anxiety and lisinopril for high blood pressure.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We will investigate further with more tests and potential referrals to specialists who can help manage Mr. Watson's hydrocephalus-related concerns. By the way, does Mr. Watson have any other symptoms he'd like to discuss?
Patient: Yes, he's been having a rash on his upper arms and torso. It hasn't spread anywhere else, though.

Doctor: Thanks for letting me know. Based on our last visit, I recommend a follow-up for Mr. Watson in 3 months. Would you like to schedule an appointment now or later?
