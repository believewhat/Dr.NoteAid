Doctor: Hi there! It's good to see you again. When was your last annual exam?
Patient: Umm, maybe a year ago or so.
Doctor: Alright. Let's talk about your type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. How long have you been dealing with these conditions?
Patient: It's been a while.
Doctor: Can you recall the number of years since your diagnosis?
Patient: Sorry, I don't remember the exact length of time.
Doctor: That's okay. I see your blood sugars have been fluctuating lately. Any idea why?
Patient: I started a new job at a bakery and my diet changed. That could be a factor.
Doctor: How have you been sleeping?
Patient: I've been sleeping well, getting a full 8 hours.
Doctor: I see. Has your blood pressure been stable despite blood sugar fluctuations?
Patient: Yes, it seems to be doing okay.
Doctor: Good to hear. Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?
Patient: No, nothing like that.
Doctor: Have you noticed any swelling in your neck or lumps under your jaw?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: Great. During our exam, we found no issues with your neck, lungs, or heart. Any chest pain or discomfort?
Patient: No, everything feels normal.
Doctor: Excellent. Your Hemoglobin A1c levels are elevated, though. Do you have a family history of diabetes or high blood sugar?
Patient: My mother had type 2 diabetes and my father had high blood pressure.
Doctor: Thank you. We'll need to monitor your blood glucose closely. Have you been taking your metformin as prescribed?
Patient: I haven't been checking often, but I take it twice a day.
Doctor: And you're taking lisinopril for your hypertension, correct?
Patient: Yes, 10 mg once daily.
Doctor: Please check your fasting blood glucose regularly and call them in about 2 weeks. Follow up in 2 months, at which time we will discuss further treatment recommendations. Continue with your hypertension treatment as well. Do you agree with this plan?
Patient: Yes, I do.
