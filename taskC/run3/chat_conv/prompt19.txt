Doctor: Hey there! How are you feeling today?
Patient: Not too great. I hurt my shoulder playing football a few days ago.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you specify which shoulder it is and where exactly the pain is located?
Patient: It's my right shoulder, and the pain is in the back of it.
Doctor: Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in the area?
Patient: No, not at all.
Doctor: That's good. How about strength in your hand? Can you lift things okay?
Patient: It's okay, but I've been avoiding lifting anything too heavy.
Doctor: Thanks for letting me know. Can you tell me if you're able to touch your shoulder to your ear?
Patient: No, the pain is too much.
Doctor: Got it. Have you tried taking any over-the-counter pain relievers, like Tylenol?
Patient: Yes, but it doesn't really help.
Doctor: Okay, we'll explore other options for pain relief. Do you have any other joint problems or neck issues?
Patient: Nope, just my shoulder.

Doctor: Have you had any fever or chills since the injury?
Patient: No fever or chills, but I do have a headache.
Doctor: I see. Did you hit your head during the injury?
Patient: Yeah, I did, but I didn't pass out or anything.
Doctor: Alright, we'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Can you tell me when you had your appendectomy?
Patient: It was around 3 to 4 years ago.

Doctor: Do you remember the exact time when you underwent the procedure?
Patient: Let me think... I believe it was during middle school, so maybe in 7th or 8th grade.
Doctor: Have you felt any discomfort or pain in the area where your appendix was removed?
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any pain or problems since the surgery.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you had any gastrointestinal issues like nausea or vomiting after the appendectomy?
Patient: No, everything has been normal.

Doctor: Let's go back to your headaches. Can you describe the type of headache you're having?
Patient: It's a throbbing pain on one side of my head.
Doctor: Have you noticed any numbness or tingling sensations during these headaches or at any other time?
Patient: No, I haven't had any numbness or tingling.
Doctor: Have you experienced any fever or chills lately?
Patient: No, I feel pretty normal in terms of temperature.

Doctor: Alright, after examining you, it appears that you have an acute acromioclavicular joint fracture in your right shoulder. I'll place you in a sling and prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once a day to treat your pain. We'll also need to get a CT scan of your right shoulder for further evaluation. Additionally, I recommend attending formal physical therapy to strengthen your shoulder and avoid future injuries. Please try to avoid any activities that involve overhead motions and tackle football for the time being. We'll monitor your headaches and explore treatment options if they continue to bother you.
Patient: Okay, thank you for your advice.
