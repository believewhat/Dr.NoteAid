Doctor: Hi there! How have you been since your recent hospitalization for acute on chronic CHF exacerbation?
Patient: I've been feeling pretty tired and getting headaches.
Doctor: Have you been feeling any symptoms related to hypertension or kidney disease lately?
Patient: Yeah, my legs have also been swelling up a bit.
Doctor: Can you describe the severity and duration of your ankle swelling?
Patient: My ankles have been swollen for a few days now. It's been bothering me quite a bit.
Doctor: How much does it bother you when you try to walk or stand for long periods of time?
Patient: It's really uncomfortable, especially when I'm on my feet.
Doctor: On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the severity of your ankle swelling?
Patient: I would say it's around a 7.
Doctor: Has the swelling been constant or does it vary?
Patient: The swelling is pretty constant, but it does seem to get worse when I'm on my feet.
Doctor: I recommend elevating your legs and applying ice to the affected areas to help reduce the swelling. Let's schedule some lab work to check your kidney function as well.
Patient: Okay, sounds good.
Doctor: How are you managing your hypertension and stage 3 chronic kidney disease?
Patient: I take my blood pressure medication every day and try to watch my salt intake. For my kidney disease, I drink plenty of water.

Patient: I've been trying to eat more fruits and vegetables, and I go on walks with my dog every day.
