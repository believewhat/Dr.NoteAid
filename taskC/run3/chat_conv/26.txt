Doctor: Hey there! How's your right heel feeling? Any improvements since we last spoke?
Patient: I haven't really noticed any changes, still hurts when I put weight on it.
Doctor: Okay, let's do a physical exam and see how things are looking. Can you tell me where the pain is located exactly?
Patient: It's mostly in the back of my heel, and sometimes it radiates up into my calf.
Doctor: Alright, I'm going to test for tenderness now. Does this hurt when I press down here? (performs calcaneal squeeze test)
Patient: Yes, that hurts quite a bit.
Doctor: And what about when I resist extension and flexion here? (performs ROM test)
Patient: There's mild pain with flexion, but more pain with extension.
Doctor: Got it. Now, can you stand on your toes for me? (performs Thompson test)
Patient: Sure. (attempts to stand on toes) No change or difference in the pain.
Doctor: Alright, based on these results, it seems like you still have tendinitis in your Achilles. Have you been continuing physical therapy and taking ibuprofen as instructed?
Patient: Yes, I've been doing both.
Doctor: Good job sticking to the treatment plan. Let's continue with conservative treatment and give it some more time to heal. Since it's been 2 weeks now, let's schedule another follow-up in 2 weeks to check progress.
Patient: Sounds good to me.
