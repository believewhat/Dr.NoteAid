Doctor: Hi there! Good to see you again. How have you been since our last meeting? I know you have coronary artery disease and stage 3 chronic kidney disease. Are you taking your medications as prescribed?

Patient: Yes, I've been following the prescription and my conditions are under control.

Doctor: Great to hear. Now, let's discuss your diabetes. Your recent hemoglobin A1c was 16. What actions have you taken to manage your diabetes since learning this?

Patient: To be honest, I haven't done much. I haven't seen a specialist or educator, but I've tried to eat more vegetables and less sugar.

Doctor: It's crucial to manage your diabetes. Have you been checking your blood sugar levels and taking diabetes medications?

Patient: I've been taking my medications, but I should check my blood sugar levels more often.

Doctor: What about increasing physical activity or exercise?

Patient: I haven't exercised much, but I'm trying to walk more and use the stairs.

Doctor: Let's discuss your heart attack. What treatments have you received and why are you taking these medications?

Patient: I take aspirin for my heart, Brilinta for blood clot prevention, fish oil and Crestor to lower cholesterol, and Metoprolol for blood pressure.

Doctor: Why both aspirin and Brilinta?

Patient: Aspirin is for my heart, and Brilinta prevents blood clots.

Doctor: What's the reason for fish oil and Crestor?

Patient: They help lower my cholesterol levels.

Doctor: Any side effects from these medications?

Patient: No, I haven't noticed any.

Doctor: I see you've experienced mild depression since your heart attack. Can you share more about your feelings and support system?

Patient: I feel depressed and lonely. I don't have anyone to talk to about it.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We can discuss therapy options and the importance of support during heart attack recovery.

Doctor: How are you today? What medications are you taking for your coronary artery disease? Any side effects?

Patient: I'm taking metoprolol and Crestor daily without side effects. The doctor told me to continue.

Doctor: Good, keep following the prescription. Have you attended cardiac rehab sessions?

Patient: Yes, rehab has helped me become more active and confident in exercising.

Doctor: Excellent. Watch for chest pain or shortness of breath during exertion. Also, dizziness when standing quickly should resolve as you adjust to the medications.

Patient: Thanks for the advice.

Doctor: Remember to follow up with Dr. Miller about your stage 3 chronic kidney disease.

Patient: I'll schedule an appointment with him.

Doctor: Your diabetes management is also essential. Your hemoglobin A1c goal is 6. We've ordered a repeat test and referred you to a dietitian. We'll contact your primary care physician about your insulin regimen.

Patient: Thank you for the information and referrals.

Doctor: Lastly, you were referred for psychiatry due to mild depression. Let us know if you have questions or concerns about that referral.

Patient: No questions for now, but I appreciate the referral.
