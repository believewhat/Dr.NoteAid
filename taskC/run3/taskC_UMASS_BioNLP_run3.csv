Follow-up of chronic problem.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Carolyn Garcia is a 49-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for follow-up of her chronic problem.

The patient reports her osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little lately, and she would like to talk about that, primarily in her elbows. She states she has been sitting at the computer more in the office, so she is unsure if it is stagnant in that position all day. She notes her right elbow bothers her more than her left elbow, but she is primarily typing all day versus writing. She denies any other joint pain. She notes occasional numbness and tingling in her hands, which she tries to shake out her arms to relieve the numbness.

She also has a history of gout. Her last episode was about 3 months ago. She had some inflammation of her toe at that time. She denies any other issues with that. She states the medication she was given at that time helped with her gout and she has not seen a flare up since.

Back pain.

HPI:

Ms. Lee is a 40-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of back pain. She states she was at a birthday party and she ran her back into the railing of the staircase and twisted her back. She denies any pain radiating down her legs. Lying flat and twisting motions aggravate the pain. She is currently taking ibuprofen.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Ibuprofen.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Anxiety.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

Lumbar fusion

EXAM

Examination of the back shows range of motion without pain. Straight leg raise is negative. Sensation is intact.

RESULTS

X-rays of the lumbar spine show no obvious signs of acute fracture. Evidence of a prior lumbar fusion with hardware in good position.

IMPRESSION

Lumbar spine strain.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended ice and heat. She will continue with Motrin 800 mg 3 times a day with food. She will follow up with me as needed.
","Doctor: Hey Ms. Lee, how are you feeling today? I wanted to ask you about the back pain you mentioned previously, but first can you tell me more about your lumbar fusion procedure?
Patient: Sure, it was a surgery to fix my lower back. They fused two of my vertebrae together to make my spine more stable. It was a few months ago, and I do feel like I can move around better now and do more things without experiencing as much pain.
Doctor: That's great to hear! Have you experienced any side effects or complications from the surgery, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs?
Patient: No, luckily I haven't had any of those. Overall, I feel like the surgery has helped me a lot and I'm glad I went through with it.
Doctor: Alright, that's good news. Now, back to your current issue - can you tell me more about your back pain? How did it start and where exactly is the pain located?
Patient: Well, I was at a birthday party and I twisted my back while dancing. Since then, the pain has been pretty bad. The pain is mostly in the middle of my back, and it's around a 6 or 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.
Doctor: I see. Does the pain radiate down your legs at all, or is it concentrated in your back?
Patient: No, it's just in my back.
Doctor: Have you noticed any positions or movements that seem to aggravate the pain, or anything that helps relieve it?
Patient: Lying flat seems to make it worse, and twisting motions definitely hurt. I haven't found anything that really helps yet.
Doctor: Thank you for letting me know. Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have strained a muscle or ligament in your back. I'll recommend some pain relief options and we can discuss further treatment if needed. By any chance, have you noticed any changes in your sodium or creatinine levels since the last time they were measured?
Patient: I don't know much about those levels, but I don't think I've had any problems with them.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Lastly, I wanted to ask you about the anxiety you mentioned in your medical history. Can you tell me more about the symptoms you experience related to your anxiety? Have you tried any relaxation techniques or coping strategies to help manage it?
Patient: Yeah, I feel really nervous and worried all the time. Sometimes my heart races and I have trouble sleeping because I can't stop thinking about things. It happens a lot, like almost every night. And during the day too, especially when I have to do something that makes me nervous or scared. I've tried deep breathing exercises and meditation, but they don't always work.
Doctor: I understand. There are other options we can explore to help manage your anxiety, such as therapy or medication. Would you be open to discussing these options further?
Patient: Yes, I would be willing to try whatever might help. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about your prior lumbar fusion and the hardware that was used?
Patient: Oh, I had a surgery on my lower back before. They fused my lumbar spine and put some hardware in there. The X-rays show that everything is in good position.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Can you describe the location and type of hardware that was used during your lumbar fusion surgery?
Patient: The hardware they used was some metal rods and screws to hold my spine in place. I think it's around the L4-L5 area.
Doctor: Could you explain any symptoms or discomfort that you've been experiencing recently in the area where the hardware was placed, such as pain, numbness, or tingling?
Patient: Well, I've been having some pain in my lower back and legs. It's been hard to walk for long periods of time.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder function since the lumbar fusion surgery, such as difficulty with urination or bowel movements?
Patient: No, I haven't had any problems with that.
Doctor: Given your symptoms and history of lumbar fusion with hardware, have you had any recent MRI or CT scans to evaluate the integrity of the fusion and the hardware?
Patient: No, I haven't had any MRI or CT scans recently. Should I get one?
Doctor: It might be a good idea to schedule one to assess the stability of the fusion and hardware. Have you noticed any recent changes in your sleep patterns, appetite, mood, or energy levels that could be related to your current symptoms?
Patient: Well, I've been having trouble sleeping because of the pain. And sometimes I don't feel like eating much when my back hurts. But overall, my mood and energy levels are pretty normal.
Doctor: Are you experiencing any changes in your pain level, range of motion, or muscle weakness since the last time you saw a doctor for your lumbar fusion surgery?
Patient: Yeah, my pain level has been getting worse and it's harder to move around. And I've noticed some weakness in my legs.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms and history of lumbar fusion, have you had any recent imaging studies to evaluate the stability of the hardware and fusion site, such as an MRI or CT scan?
Patient: No, I haven't had any of those tests recently.
Doctor: Have you had any recent follow-up appointments with your surgeon or doctor to evaluate the stability of your lumbar fusion, given your worsening pain level, range of motion, and weakness?
Patient: No, I haven't seen my surgeon in a while. Should I make an appointment?
Doctor: Yes, it would be a good idea to schedule an appointment with your surgeon to assess the stability of the hardware and fusion site, given your recent symptoms. We want to make sure that everything is progressing well and that there aren't any new issues that need to be addressed. Additionally, have you been taking the Motrin as recommended, and have you noticed any improvement in your lower back pain?
Patient: No, I haven't been taking the Motrin. I didn't realize it needed to be taken with food.
Doctor: It's important to take the Motrin with food to prevent stomach upset. Please start taking it as directed and let me know if there is any improvement in your pain. And have you tried any other treatments besides ice and heat therapy to manage your lower back pain?
Patient: No, I haven't tried anything else.
Doctor: If the Motrin and ice/heat therapy aren't effective in relieving your pain, we can explore other treatment options at your follow-up appointment."

","Doctor: Hi there! How have you been feeling since your last visit?
Patient: Honestly, I haven't really been feeling any different.
Doctor: I wanted to follow up on your lab results. Your labs showed abnormal levels for Sodium and Creatinine, which are related to your kidneys. Your thyroid levels were also not normal.
Patient: Maybe that's because I didn't know about these lab results until now.
Doctor: It's good that you're not experiencing any symptoms. Let's discuss your fatigue, swollen elbow joints, bullseye rash, body aches, and nausea. Did anything happen before these symptoms started?
Patient: Yes, I had an insect bite after hiking in the woods.
Doctor: We did a Lyme titer test, and it came back positive for Lyme disease. Have you experienced any high fevers or joint pain from the Lyme disease?
Patient: No, I haven't had high fevers or joint pain, but my fatigue is pretty bad.
Doctor: And have you started taking antibiotics as prescribed for your Lyme disease?
Patient: Yes, I have started taking the antibiotics as prescribed.
Doctor: That's good to hear. It's important to take the full course of antibiotics as directed and follow up with us if you have any concerns. Let me know if you experience any side effects or improvements in your fatigue.
Doctor: Regarding your diabetes and hypertension, how have your blood sugars been?
Patient: My blood sugars have been okay, and I'm still taking metformin.

Doctor: Are you experiencing any abdominal pain or diarrhea?
Patient: No, I'm not having any abdominal pain or diarrhea.
Doctor: Excellent. We will start you on a course of antibiotics to treat the infection caused by Lyme disease. Based on your positive Lyme titer, it's important that you take them as directed.

Patient: No, it hasn't changed much.
Doctor: Have you started using any new skincare products or been in contact with anything unusual?
Patient: I haven't used anything new or been in contact with anything unusual.
Doctor: Alright. Given your other symptoms, I'm going to order some tests to check for any underlying conditions. But for now, I'll prescribe something for the rash to help with the itching. Let me take a look at your elbows first.
Doctor: During the examination, I noticed warmth in your abdomen when I touched it. Did you notice any pain or tenderness in that area?
Patient: No, there wasn't any pain or tenderness when you touched my abdomen.
Doctor: That's good to hear. However, I did notice swelling and pain when I palpated your elbow joints. Can you tell me more about that?

Doctor: Also, I see a small bullseye rash on the left abdominal quadrant. Are you experiencing any discomfort or itching in that area?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any discomfort or itching from the rash.
Doctor: Based on your recent camping trip, it's possible that the bullseye rash and joint pain may be related to Lyme disease. We already started you on antibiotics for this, so hopefully, that will help with your symptoms. In the meantime, we will continue monitoring your condition and administering additional tests as needed. If you experience any worsening symptoms or side effects from the medication, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
Doctor: Moving on, based on your recent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, sore throat, hoarseness, fever/chills, and fatigue, I would like to order additional tests to check for any underlying conditions. Have you noticed any other concerning symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, or chest pain?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any other concerning symptoms besides the ones I mentioned earlier.
Doctor: Alright. It's important that we monitor your condition closely and administer any necessary treatments. In the meantime, I'll prescribe something to help with your sore throat and hoarseness.

Patient: Right now, I'm taking medication and making some lifestyle changes like eating healthier and exercising regularly to manage both my diabetes and high blood pressure.
Doctor: Great to hear that you're taking steps towards self-care. Keep it up, and we'll continue to monitor your progress during our future appointments. Also, we'll keep an eye on your kidney function and thyroid levels and adjust your treatment plan accordingly.
Doctor: How has your compliance been with taking the prescribed medication for your newly diagnosed Lyme disease?

Doctor: That's great to hear! Have you experienced any side effects from taking the doxycycline for your Lyme disease?
Patient: No, I haven't had any side effects from the medicine.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvements in your symptoms since starting the doxycycline for Lyme disease?
Patient: Yeah, I think I'm starting to feel better. My fever has gone down and my joint pain isn't as bad as it was before.
Doctor: Good to know! How frequently have you been taking the doxycycline medication for your Lyme disease since we last spoke?
Patient: I've been taking the doxycycline twice a day, every day since you prescribed it.
Doctor: Can you tell me if you have been experiencing any symptoms related to your kidneys or thyroid since we last spoke about your abnormal lab results?
Patient: I don't think so, Doctor. I haven't noticed anything different or unusual with my kidneys or thyroid.
Doctor: Great. Moving on to your hypertension, how has your blood pressure been at home?
Patient: It's been well-controlled, thanks to the dietary modifications I've made to limit my sodium intake.
Doctor: That's excellent news. I am going to order a lipid panel just to be thorough. Also, regarding your diabetes type 2, have you been having any issues with nausea due to the medication or diet restrictions?
Patient: Yes, I've had some nausea because of the Lyme disease, but I've been compliant with the use of metformin and following the recommended diet.
Doctor: Okay. I will order a hemoglobin A1c test to ensure no changes are needed to your medication. Lastly, I want to remind you to maintain your healthy lifestyle choices and continue taking your medications as prescribed. Regular follow-up appointments are essential for monitoring your progress and making any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the pain? Is it constant or intermittent?
Patient: The pain comes and goes, but it's been more frequent lately. It gets worse when I'm walking or standing for extended periods of time.
Doctor: Does anything seem to trigger it or make it worse?
Patient: Not really, it just seems to be worse during those activities.

Patient: I've taken some over-the-counter pain relievers and used a heating pad, but they haven't helped much.
Doctor: Okay, it's important to get a better understanding of what might be causing your joint pain. I'd like to examine your knees and possibly order some imaging tests.
Doctor: We can also discuss non-medical interventions such as rest or exercises to improve your symptoms. How does that sound?

Doctor: You're welcome. Before we proceed with the examination, did you have any other concerns or symptoms you wanted to discuss?

Patient: Yes, I understand and agree. Also, I've noticed that I snore pretty loudly sometimes and wake up gasping for air. Is that concerning?
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, I'm concerned about the possibility of sleep apnea. We'll need to conduct a sleep study to confirm whether or not that's the case.
Patient: Alright, I'll do whatever it takes to feel better. Thanks again, doc.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll schedule the necessary tests and appointments for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Take care, and I'll see you at your next appointment.
Patient: One more thing, doctor. I've also been feeling tired during the day, even though I get enough sleep at night. Could that be related to my joint pain or the possible sleep apnea?
Doctor: It's possible that the daytime fatigue could be related to sleep apnea, especially if you're waking up gasping for air at night. When sleep apnea goes untreated, it can cause poor quality sleep, leading to daytime tiredness. Additionally, chronic pain from your joint issues could also contribute to your fatigue.
Doctor: Once we have a better understanding of your sleep and joint conditions, we can develop a more comprehensive treatment plan to address your daytime tiredness.
Patient: Thanks, doctor. It's been tough trying to manage my daily activities with the pain and fatigue. I appreciate your help in figuring this out.
Doctor: I understand how difficult it can be to manage pain and fatigue, especially when it affects your daily life. Rest assured, we'll do our best to find the underlying causes and develop a treatment plan that works for you.
Doctor: In the meantime, try to prioritize rest and self-care, and let me know if there are any significant changes in your symptoms.
Patient: I'll do my best, doctor. Thank you for your understanding and support.

Patient: My depression has been under control, I'm taking my medication as prescribed and going to therapy every week. My blood pressure has been fluctuating but I'm using my medications as recommended.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your blood pressure more closely and discuss any further concerns you have. Also, it's important to have an annual exam. Would you like to schedule one now?
Patient: Sure, let's do that. Have you been experiencing any headaches lately?
Doctor: Yes, I've been having some headaches. Are they happening frequently or only occasionally?
Patient: They're pretty frequent.
Doctor: Have you noticed anything that triggers them or makes them worse?
Patient: No, not really. They just come on randomly.
Doctor: Okay, we can work on improving that. We'll get some tests done to check your blood pressure and see if there's anything else going on. During our last visit, we noted that your mood and affect were appropriate. Have you noticed any changes in your emotional state since then?
Patient: No, everything has been fine on that front.
Doctor: Great to hear. Let's move on to your physical exam. Your neck appears supple without any signs of thyromegaly or cervical lymphadenopathy. Did you notice any discomfort or swelling in this area?
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any issues with my neck recently. So, what does elevated mean? Do I have high blood pressure?
Doctor: Elevated means higher than the normal range. Based on your previous visit, it seems that your blood pressure was higher than normal. Have you experienced any headaches or vision changes lately?
Patient: Oh, I see. Yes, I think you mentioned that last time. No, I haven't had any headaches or problems with my vision.
Doctor: Okay, let's monitor your blood pressure more closely and make sure it stays within a healthy range. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or ask about?
Patient: Not really, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, doctor. By the way, I've been struggling with hypertension due to my busy schedule at work and unhealthy eating habits. Any suggestions?
Doctor: Have you tried meal prepping on the weekends or utilizing healthy food delivery services to make eating healthier more convenient for your busy schedule?
Patient: No, I haven't tried that yet. That could be a good idea though!
Doctor: Okay, we'll increase your lisinopril to 10 mg once daily and continue to monitor at home. Let's follow up in 1 month. Switching gears, how is your carpal tunnel release doing? It's been 2 years since the surgery, right?
Patient: Yeah, everything has been fine. I haven't had any symptoms.
Doctor: Great to hear. Just remember to contact us if any symptoms return. Lastly, just to confirm, you understand and agree with the recommended medical treatment plan?
Patient: Yes, I do.
Doctor: Alright then. Take care and we'll see you next month."

Follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female presenting today for an annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.

Mrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.

She hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.

Over the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.

She notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.

Mrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.

She has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.

The patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Asthma.
Allergy rhinitis.
Food allergies to peanut and tree nuts.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Currently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Wixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.
Proair HFA as needed.
EpiPen as needed.
Alvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.

ALLERGIES

Peanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.
Montelukast sodium, -eizure-like-reaction.

RESULTS

Asthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.
Current food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.

ASSESSMENT

-Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.
-Allergic rhinitis.
-Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

PLAN

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
The patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.

Allergic rhinitis
She will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
The patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.

INSTRUCTIONS

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
Start Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.

Allergic rhinitis
Continue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
Continue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today.","Doctor: Hi there! How are you doing today? I remember we talked about your asthma and allergies last time, how have they been since then?
Patient: Actually, I've been struggling with my asthma and allergies lately. I've had some asthma attacks and my allergies have been bothering me almost every day.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's talk about your asthma medication first. Are you taking it regularly?
Patient: I try to take my inhaler as prescribed, but sometimes I forget.
Doctor: It's important to be consistent with your medication. Now, how about your allergies? Are you avoiding known triggers like peanuts and tree nuts?
Patient: Yes, I make sure to avoid peanuts and tree nuts as much as possible.
Doctor: That's good. Have you noticed any specific triggers for your other allergies or reactions besides peanuts?
Patient: Not really, they seem to happen randomly. But peanuts always cause a reaction for me.
Doctor: I see. Have you ever been prescribed Montelukast sodium for your allergies?
Patient: Yes, I have. But I experienced a ""seizure-like"" reaction to it and had to stop taking it.
Doctor: That's concerning. Have you ever been hospitalized for your peanut allergy before?
Patient: Yes, I've been to the hospital a few times because of my peanut allergy. It's really scary when it happens.
Doctor: It's important to be prepared for emergencies. Do you always carry an epinephrine auto-injector with you?
Patient: Yes, I always carry an epinephrine auto-injector with me in case of a severe reaction to peanuts. My doctor told me to.
Doctor: Great, keep carrying it with you at all times. Now, let's talk about the rash on your arm. Have you had any recent travel or exposure to new substances that might have caused it?
Patient: No, nothing out of the ordinary. I haven't had any recent travel or exposure to new substances, and I haven't changed my hygiene routine or used any new personal care products.
Doctor: Okay, we'll take a closer look at it later. In the meantime, let's focus on managing your asthma and allergies. Have you been experiencing any breathing difficulties or chest tightness lately?
Patient: Yeah, I still feel a bit of difficulty breathing sometimes, but it's not as bad as before.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Are you taking your Wixela Inhub and Alvesco medications as prescribed?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking them every day like you told me to.
Doctor: Great. Have you noticed any triggers that seem to worsen your breathing difficulties?
Patient: It seems to get worse when I'm doing intense exercise or around smoke or strong smells.
Doctor: Try to avoid those triggers as much as possible. Now, let's discuss your asthma history. Have you noticed any triggers for your asthma symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, whenever I'm around smoke or dust, my breathing gets really bad. It's hard for me to catch my breath.
Doctor: Have you been avoiding smoke and dust as much as possible?
Patient: Yeah, I try to stay away from them as much as I can. But sometimes it's hard, especially when I'm outside or around other people who smoke.
Doctor: I understand. Have you tried using a rescue inhaler during these episodes?
Patient: Yeah, I have. It helps a little bit, but I still feel like I'm struggling to breathe.
Doctor: We could consider using a daily maintenance inhaler to help prevent asthma symptoms. What do you think?
Patient: I haven't thought about that. What does it do?
Doctor: It reduces inflammation in your airways, which can make your asthma symptoms less severe and frequent. Given your history of moderate persistent asthma, it may be worth considering. Now, let's talk about your peanut allergy. Have you been avoiding peanuts since your anaphylactic reaction?
Patient: Yes, I have. I've been really careful to read food labels and avoid anything with peanuts in it.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Do you also experience allergic rhinitis, or nasal allergies?
Patient: Yes, I do. My nose gets really stuffy and runny, especially in the spring and fall.
Doctor: We'll want to keep an eye on that as well. In the meantime, let's discuss the possibility of starting a maintenance inhaler for your asthma. Moving on, I understand you have aspirations to join the military. Can you tell me more about that and how your asthma may affect that goal?
Patient: Yeah, I really want to join the military but I heard they have physical fitness requirements that I need to meet without using my inhaler. So that's been on my mind.
Doctor: Have you discussed your aspirations to join the military with your primary care physician?
Patient: No, I haven't talked to my doctor about it yet.
Doctor: It may be a good idea to schedule an appointment with them to discuss this further and undergo pulmonary function tests to assess your lung function. This can help determine whether alternative treatment options or accommodations may be necessary to help you achieve your goals while still managing your asthma effectively.
Patient: Thanks for the advice, doc. And thank you for checking out my rash too."

High blood pressure and palpitations.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jordan Roberts is a 49-year-old with a long history of hypertension and an acute episode of palpitations.

In March, Mr. Roberts went to the emergency room for palpitations and hypertension. He attributed this to a panic attack, but also stated he consumed several cups of coffee on an empty stomach the morning of. He denies additional episodes of palpitations.

He has been monitoring his blood pressure at home daily, obtaining systolic blood pressure readings of 146 to 155. He does report a family history of hypertension. Additionally, he has been monitoring his salt intake and feels he is doing well at reducing it. He also walks on his treadmill as often as he can.

He has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication Benicar HCT, which he has been using for the past month.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypertension.

FAMILY HISTORY

Several family members positive for hypertension.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benicar HCT 40 mg/25 mg
Amlodipine 10 mg daily.

Physical Examination

Cardiovascular
Normal rate, regular rhythm, S2 normal, normal heart sounds, and normal pulses.

Pulmonary/Chest
Breath sounds normal. 

Abdominal
There is no tenderness.

Musculoskeletal
There is no edema.

RESULTS

Thyroid profile 03/01/2021.

ASSESSMENT

-Resistant hypertension.

Mr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension, with systolic blood pressure readings between 146-155. He is currently on maximal doses for 3 medications.

PLAN

I have added spironolactone to his regimen which will require monitoring of his potassium and sodium. We will schedule him for a follow up in 2 weeks to complete a basic metabolic panel and check his blood pressure. Next medication to consider adding is carvedilol. I have tried to avoid this, given the potential for issues with erectile dysfunction. I counseled the patient about spironolactone side effects, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, as well as his increased risk of dehydration, with one sign to watch for being dizziness. If we are not able to improve his blood pressure with spironolactone, the next step would be sending him to the resistant hypertension clinic.

I provided and reviewed with Mr. Roberts the American Heart association website (heart.org) and encouraged him to access for tips on lowering his salt intake and increasing his potassium intake. His maximum salt intake should be 1500 to <2000 mg per day. He was provided materials to follow the DASH diet and encouraged to meet 30-min of walking most days.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment in 2 weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel. Reduce sodium intake to 1500 to <2000 mg per day. Follow DASH diet.
","Doctor: Hi there, good to see you again. Last time we spoke, we discussed your hypertension. How has your blood pressure been lately?
Patient: It's still consistently high. I've noticed it goes up when I'm stressed or anxious.
Doctor: I see. Have you made any changes to your diet or exercise routine to help lower your blood pressure?
Patient: I've been trying to eat healthier and incorporate more fruits and vegetables into my meals, but it hasn't made much of a difference.
Doctor: Considering your history of obesity and tobacco use, have you thought about working with a nutritionist or quitting smoking to help lower your blood pressure?
Patient: Yes, I know I need to make some changes. I've been thinking about quitting smoking and getting help with my diet.
Doctor: Great, let's work together to come up with a plan that works for you. In the meantime, how often do you monitor your blood pressure?
Patient: I check it daily with a machine at home.
Doctor: Good. Have you experienced any side effects since starting your medications?
Patient: No, I haven't had any issues.
Doctor: That's good to hear. On another note, you mentioned fast heartbeats and palpitations during our last appointment. Would you be okay with an EKG to rule out potential issues?
Patient: Yes, that sounds good.
Doctor: Excellent, let's schedule that for you. Also, I added spironolactone to your medication regimen. Are you aware of the need to monitor potassium and sodium levels while taking it?
Patient: Yes, I'll keep that in mind.
Doctor: Have you experienced any side effects such as dizziness, gynecomastia, electrolyte disturbances, or dehydration since starting spironolactone?
Patient: No, I haven't felt anything unusual.
Doctor: Great. Let's schedule a follow-up in two weeks for a basic metabolic panel and blood pressure check. If your blood pressure doesn't improve, we may have to consider the resistant hypertension clinic. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up or if you have any questions.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Have you considered trying stress management techniques like meditation or yoga to help lower your stress levels?
Patient: No, I haven't tried those yet.
Doctor: I recommend incorporating those techniques into your daily routine. Keep checking in with me and let me know how you're doing. We may need to adjust your medication dosage or try different medications if your blood pressure doesn't improve.
Patient: I'll give those techniques a try. I appreciate your help and guidance.
Doctor: I'm glad you're open to trying new approaches. Remember that managing hypertension is a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and stress management. It's important to stay consistent and make adjustments as needed.
Patient: I understand. I'll do my best to make these changes and stay consistent with them.
Doctor: That's the right attitude. Also, I recommend meeting with a nutritionist or dietician to help you create a meal plan that will better suit your tastes and still be healthy for you. They can provide valuable insights and support.
Patient: I'll look into scheduling an appointment with a nutritionist soon. Thanks for the suggestion.
Doctor: You're welcome. It's important to have a support system in place to help you make lasting changes. I'm confident that with the right plan and consistent effort, we'll be able to manage your hypertension more effectively.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'm feeling more hopeful about managing my blood pressure now.
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, I'm here to support you throughout this process. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. We'll see you in two weeks for your follow-up appointment, and we'll assess your progress then.
Patient: Sounds good. See you in two weeks.
Doctor: Take care and keep up the good work. See you soon!

Follow up irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Brittany Edwards is a pleasant 32-year-old female who returns in follow up for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with functional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Ms. Edwards was last seen in August 2019 with flares of abdominal pain and was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome that was treated with Bentyl. She had a previous prescription for Reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea. She was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement such as Citrucel daily, probiotics to help with gas and bloating, and Bentyl up to 4 times daily for intestinal cramping. She was instructed to discontinue Reglan and to use Zofran as needed for nausea. Neuromodulators such as Elavil and Buspar were discussed but not started.

Ms. Edwards continues to have intermittent abdominal symptoms. Monday through Thursday she has less flare ups of her symptoms but states she is currently having cramps and sharp pains. She describes she recently ate shrimp which caused her to have both upper and lower abdominal pain and bloating. However, she notices episodes of diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and consuming alcohol. She does not believe the alfredo contributes to her symptoms. The patient states she consumes 2 drinks when out of either tequila or brown liquor and occasionally a martini. She does her best to avoid -eavy foods,-but ate fried chicken today without any symptoms. She has stopped drinking sodas which has been helpful.-he patient reports passing 2-3 formed stools a day.

Follow up adult hydrocephalus, 3 months status post shunt surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow up of adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing shunt surgery 08/01/2020. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, together they give his history.

I have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020. He presented with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on 08/01/2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.

Mr. Watson has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter states that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder control, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Theresa and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Hannah summarized it best according to the two of them, she said - feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.-Mr. Watson has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen.

PAST HISTORY

Urinary incontinence.
Adult hydrocephalus.
Gait impairment.
Cognitive impairment.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

-Constitutional Symptoms: Significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions. Negative for fever or unintentional weight loss.
-Genitourinary: Significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper. Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output.
-Neurological: Significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment. Negative for headaches, recent falls, or hallucinations.
-Psychiatric: Negative for depression, excessive worrying, or mood swings.

VITALS

Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Mr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.

Head and Face
The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.

Neurological
Mental status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.
Gait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.
Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.
Motor: Normal for bulk and strength.
Coordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.

RESULTS

CT scan of the head from 10/15/2020: It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.

ASSESSMENT

-Adult hydrocephalus.
-Gait impairment.
-Urinary incontinence and urgency.
-Cognitive impairment.

Mr. Watson has made some improvement with his hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. There is a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.

Mr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.

PLAN

I had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 3 months.","Doctor: Hey there, it's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since your shunt surgery for hydrocephalus?
Patient: I've been feeling okay since the surgery, thanks for asking.
Doctor: That's good to hear. How about Mr. Watson, how has he been doing since his shunt surgery in August 2020?
Patient: My dad has been doing pretty well too. He's been feeling better and his headaches have gone down a bit.
Doctor: Great progress for both of you. Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms since the surgery?
Patient: Well, I don't feel as much pressure in my head anymore and my headaches have decreased.
Doctor: And how about Mr. Watson? Any changes in his symptoms or overall health since his surgery?
Patient: My dad hasn't had any major issues since his surgery. We're just glad that it seems to have helped him.
Doctor: That's reassuring. How is your recovery progressing after the shunt surgery?
Patient: My recovery is going pretty well. I'm able to move around just fine.
Doctor: Have you experienced any issues with wound healing or pain management?
Patient: No, I haven't had any pain or complications.
Doctor: How about your mobility? Have you had any difficulties?
Patient: My mobility is fine, too.
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. Now, tell me about the trouble you're having walking and cognitive impairment.
Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble walking and my mind feels a bit foggy.
Doctor: How long have you been experiencing these issues?
Patient: It's been going on for a while now.
Doctor: Are there any specific cognitive difficulties that you've been facing?
Patient: Sometimes I forget things easily and have trouble concentrating on tasks for too long.
Doctor: When did you first notice these symptoms?
Patient: I can't remember exactly when it started.
Doctor: Have they progressed over time?
Patient: Yes, it's getting worse over time.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about your walking difficulties? Are you stumbling or having trouble with balance?
Patient: It's harder to walk without stumbling, and my thinking is slowing down too.
Doctor: Have you experienced any other symptoms related to adult hydrocephalus?
Patient: I've also been dealing with gait impairment and urinary incontinence and urgency.
Doctor: It seems we should investigate further regarding your cognitive and walking issues. We will need to run some tests. I see you had a CT scan of the head. Can you tell me more about the tiny amount of blood in your right frontal region and small vessel ischemic change?
Patient: Oh yeah, during the scan they found a little bit of blood in my right frontal region and some small vessel ischemic change.
Doctor: Were you experiencing any symptoms before the scan?
Patient: I was feeling dizzy and had a headache for a few days before the scan.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your vision or speech since the scan?
Patient: No, my vision and speech are okay.
Doctor: How about your balance? Are you still feeling off balance sometimes?
Patient: Yes, sometimes I feel a little off balance, but nothing too bad.
Doctor: Do you have any other symptoms besides dizziness, headache, and off-balance sensation?
Patient: No, my memory and concentration are okay. It's just the dizziness and headache that bother me sometimes.
Doctor: How have you been coping with your cognitive difficulties? Have they caused you any anxiety or stress?
Patient: I've been feeling more anxious and stressed lately because of my cognitive difficulties.
Doctor: I understand. We will schedule some tests and appointments to investigate your cognitive and walking issues, as well as the small vessel ischemic change seen on your CT scan. In the meantime, I can prescribe some medication to help manage your symptoms. Can you tell me about the CT scan of the head you had on 10/15/2020?
Patient: Oh yeah, I had been having really bad headaches and my doctor wanted to make sure everything was okay. So they ordered a CT scan of the head on that date.
Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications?
Patient: Yes, I'm taking some meds.
Doctor: Can you please tell me more about what medications you are taking and why you are taking them?
Patient: Sure. I'm taking Xanax for anxiety and lisinopril for high blood pressure.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Based on your symptoms, we will investigate further with more tests and potential referrals to specialists who can help manage your hydrocephalus-related concerns. By the way, do you have any other symptoms you'd like to discuss?
Patient: Yes, I've been having a rash on my upper arms and torso. It hasn't spread anywhere else, though.
Doctor: Thanks for letting me know. Based on our last visit, I recommend a follow-up in 3 months. Would you like to schedule an appointment now or later?"

Mrs. Taylor presents for a follow-up for hypertension. History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.

PLAN

Alcohol use disorder
I will start her on naltrexone which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17. We reviewed side effects and risks. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to the patient.

Hypertension
She will continue taking lisinopril 10 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. Quite possibly her blood pressure will improve significantly if she is able to completely stop consuming alcohol. Target BP is 130-140/70-80. I will see her back week of June 14 which likely will be the time of her second naltrexone injection.

Recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and Shingrix #2, she defers this.

Rheumatoid arthritis management.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Nelson is a 72-year-old male who presents today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis. He was last seen by me on 03/04/2021, where he received a steroid injection to his right knee. He continues to experience right knee pain and swelling. The pain level is 6/10. He notes when he stands after he has been sitting for a while, he has to use a cane to ""get his bearings."" The injection he received to the right knee at the last visit was only beneficial for a few weeks. The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not attended physical therapy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Musculoskeletal
Lower right extremity: Swollen right knee, slightly reduced range of motion. Skin warm to touch. Lower right leg pits with pressure.

PROCEDURE

Fluid aspiration and Steroid injection.
Risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained. The risks of steroid injection were explained, including but not limited to, hypopigmentation, soft tissue atrophy, tendon ruptures, and transient hyperglycemia among others. Verbal consent was obtained. The right knee was accessed through the lateral approach with 3 mL of initially clear fluid then blood-tinged fluid. Then the right knee was prepped in a standard fashion. The right knee was injected with 80 mg triamcinolone and 1 mL lidocaine. The procedure was tolerated well with no complications. Post procedure instructions were given.

ASSESSMENT

-Rheumatoid arthritis management.
-High risk medication use.
-Right knee pain.
-Lower extremity pitting edema.

PLAN

Rheumatoid arthritis management.
The patient will continue Xeljanz XR 11 mg daily. He will also continue Celebrex 200 mg daily.

High-risk medication use.
The patient is currently on the high-risk medication Xeljanz. We will check his CMP levels and monitor periodically every couple of months.

Right knee pain.
He has right knee pain and swelling, with pain level 6/10. On exam today, the right knee continues to be hot, which is ongoing inflammation. We performed a fluid aspiration of the right knee today, see procedure note above. A steroid injection to the right knee was given today, see procedure note above. We will arrange for x-ray of the right knee and refer his to physical therapy.

Lower extremity pitting edema.
The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not seen his PCP. We discussed compression stockings, elevate feet, and a low salt diet. He will check with his PCP for further instructions.","Doctor: Hi there! How are you feeling today? I see that you're currently managing your rheumatoid arthritis. Can you tell me what medications you're taking for it?
Patient: I'm taking Xeljanz XR 11 mg and Celebrex 200 mg every day.
Doctor: I'm glad to hear you're on a treatment plan. Have these medications been helping with your rheumatoid arthritis symptoms?
Patient: They've been really helpful. My joints don't hurt as much and I can move around more easily.
Doctor: That's great news. Now, you mentioned your right knee has been bothering you. Can you describe the pain?
Patient: Yes. The pain level is at around 6 out of 10.
Doctor: What about any swelling you're experiencing?
Patient: My right knee is swollen.
Doctor: During the exam today, we found that there's still ongoing inflammation in your right knee. We performed a fluid aspiration and gave you a steroid injection. Do you know what fluid aspiration is?
Patient: I've heard of it, but I'm not exactly sure what it involves.
Doctor: Fluid aspiration involves removing excess fluid from your knee joint using a needle and syringe. This can help relieve pressure and reduce inflammation. Are you familiar with steroid injections?
Patient: Not exactly, can you explain?
Doctor: The steroid injection helps to further reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. We'll also arrange for an x-ray and refer you to physical therapy for additional support. How does that sound?
Patient: That sounds like a good plan.
Doctor: Great. Now, let's discuss the edema in your lower extremities. Have you tried wearing compression stockings?
Patient: I usually wear support hose, but it hasn't helped much.
Doctor: Have you tried elevating your feet?
Patient: I haven't seen my PCP yet.
Doctor: I recommend trying compression stockings, elevating your feet, and following a low salt diet to help manage the edema. But it's important to check with your PCP for further instructions and guidance.
Patient: I'll do that. Thanks for the advice.
Doctor: You're welcome. I also want to mention that Xeljanz is considered a high-risk medication. We'll need to monitor your CMP levels periodically every couple of months. Are you aware of this?
Patient: Yes, I understand the need for monitoring.
Doctor: Good. Before we end our session, I want to ensure you're aware of the risks and benefits associated with the fluid aspiration and steroid injection we performed today. Have you fully considered these risks before consenting to the procedure?
Patient: Yes, I understand the risks and I'm willing to proceed with the treatment plan.
Doctor: Great. Thank you for coming in today, and we'll see you at your next appointment. If you have any concerns or questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out."

Follow-up for perioral dermatitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Perioral dermatitis.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Doxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.
MetroCream. 
Sulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Integumentary
Skin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.

ASSESSMENT

-Perioral dermatitis
-Rosacea, including ocular rosacea

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist- recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.

PLAN

Perioral dermatitis.
I counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.

Rosacea, including ocular rosacea.
Continue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.

INSTRUCTIONS

Call the clinic if symptoms worsen. The patient will have a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks.","Doctor: Hi Jacqueline, how are you feeling today? Let's start by talking about your perioral dermatitis. Have you been using doxycycline as prescribed?
Patient: Yes, I've been applying it twice daily as instructed by the doctor. I haven't noticed any changes yet.
Doctor: That's good to hear. We want to make sure we reach full resolution before reducing the application to once a day. Are you planning to resume using Elidel?
Patient: No, I can't afford it without insurance.
Doctor: Alright, no problem. I'll prescribe Tacrolimus instead. Just be aware of any possible side effects while using the medication.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: And continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.
Patient: Understood.
Doctor: It seems that your skin around the mouth area is still bothering you. Based on your symptoms, it could be an allergic reaction or a bacterial infection. I'm prescribing a topical antibiotic cream for you.
Patient: How often should I use the cream?
Doctor: Use it twice a day for two weeks. We can schedule a follow-up visit to see how it's doing.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Now, let's move on to your rosacea, including ocular rosacea. How has MetroCream been working for you?
Patient: It's been helping a bit, but not as much as I'd like.
Doctor: Have you been following the recommended regime?
Patient: Yes, I have.
Doctor: Good to know. I recommend gently washing your eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and trying a gentle cream like Vanicream.
Patient: I'll give that a try.
Doctor: By the way, have you had any difficulty breathing or shortness of breath lately?
Patient: No, I can breathe fine. But I've been having a lot of stomach problems.
Doctor: Can you describe your stomach problems?
Patient: Sometimes I feel really nauseous and don't want to eat anything, but other times I'm really hungry.
Doctor: And have you had any headaches, dizziness, or blurred vision recently?
Patient: Yes, I've been getting these really bad headaches and sometimes my vision gets all blurry.
Doctor: Alright, thanks for letting me know. Let's check if there are any underlying issues that might be causing these problems. Can you come back next week for some tests and a follow-up on your perioral dermatitis?
Patient: Sure, I can do that.
Doctor: Also, based on your oily skin and occasional pimples, I recommend using a gentle cleanser and oil-free moisturizer twice a day.
Patient: Should I continue using the Doxycycline cream and Sulfacetamide wash?
Doctor: Yes, use Doxycycline cream twice daily, apply MetroCream as directed, and use Sulfacetamide wash topically twice daily. These will help to address any acne or oiliness concerns you have.
Doctor: Additionally, did you experience any side effects from the Tylenol with codeine such as drowsiness or difficulty concentrating?
Patient: Yeah, I feel really sleepy and kind of out of it. But my head still hurts.
Doctor: Okay. Have you been able to keep any food or liquids down, or have you been experiencing vomiting along with the nausea and headache?
Patient: I've been able to keep some food down, but not a lot. And I haven't thrown up yet, but I feel like I might.
Doctor: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your sensitivity to light or nausea since taking the medication and resting for a day?
Patient: The medicine is helping a little bit with the pain, but I still feel sensitive to light and nauseous.
Doctor: Understood. Let's schedule some tests and a follow-up visit to get to the bottom of your symptoms. If you experience any side effects from the medications or any new symptoms, give us a call. See you next week for our follow-up visit.
Doctor: Oh, one more thing - can you tell me about your immunization history? Have you received any shots in the last year?
Patient: I don't remember getting any shots recently, so I'm not sure.
Doctor: Alright. Have you experienced any symptoms or illnesses since your last visit?
Patient: Yeah, I had a cold a few weeks ago and my nose was stuffy, but it went away on its own. Other than that, I've been feeling pretty good.
Doctor: Thanks for letting me know. Lastly, you mentioned you have been experiencing fatigue and weakness, weight loss, and loss of appetite. In addition, you mentioned headaches and blurry vision. Let's dive deeper into those symptoms during our follow-up visit next week.
Patient: That sounds like a good plan.
Doctor: Can you also tell me if any imaging tests were ordered or mentioned during your appointment?
Patient: I don't think so, Doc. You didn't mention any imaging tests during my appointment.
Doctor: Okay, that's fine. Now, can you tell me about your gynecologic history, such as any surgeries or past issues?
Patient: Oh sure. I have never had any surgeries or issues with my lady parts. Everything has been normal for me in that area.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Can you describe your menstrual cycle? How long are your periods and how often do they come?
Patient: Well, it's been a while since I've had my period. They used to come every month but now they hardly ever come.
Doctor: I see. How long has it been since your last period?
Patient: Honestly, I can't even remember. It's been a while.
Doctor: Okay, no problem. Let's address your current symptoms first and then we can take a closer look at your menstrual cycle and any related issues during our follow-up visit.
Patient: Sounds good to me, Doctor.
Doctor: Have you ever experienced any allergic reactions in the past?
Patient: No, I haven't had any allergic reactions before.
Doctor: What is your past medical history? Have you had any health issues in the past?
Patient: Nope, never had any other medical history.
Doctor: Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, had surgeries or hospitalizations, or taken any long-term medications in the past?

Doctor: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. When did you start noticing the worsening symptoms?
Patient: It's been about a week or so now.
Doctor: Have you been taking your medication as prescribed? Any side effects?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking it regularly. Sometimes it makes me feel a little nauseous, but nothing too serious.
Doctor: Alright, we may need to adjust your medication dosage or try a different type. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check on your progress. And if anything changes or gets worse before then, please don't hesitate to call the clinic."

Abdominal pain.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports enjoying nature photography.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports family history of cholelithiasis. Both of his parents have had cholecystectomies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports low-grade fevers.
Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air.
Body Temperature: Afebrile.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No ectopic beats. No murmurs, clicks, or rubs.

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: Soft, nondistended abdomen. Positive slight guarding to the right upper quadrant, but without rebound tenderness. Positive for Murphy signs. Peritoneal signs not appreciated.
- Auscultation: Bowel sounds normal in all 4 quadrants.

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound obtained at an outside facility is reviewed today. This demonstrates multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder. I do appreciate some mild thickening. The common bile duct size is within normal limits at 4.1 mm.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Mild cholecystitis with gallstones.
- Medical Reasoning: Based on the patient's symptoms, exam findings, and ultrasound, I do believe he has some mild cholecystitis with gallstones. I do not appreciate any frank obstruction, but it looks like his gallbladder is inflamed. This appears to have happened maybe over the last few weeks or since he has been symptomatic.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses of care were described and discussed. I explained the surgery will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, and he will probably spend the night in the hospital for post-procedure monitoring. We also discussed that he should avoid high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are high in fiber. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Since he has not had any improvement with dietary modifications, I recommend a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A mutually agreed upon surgical date has been scheduled for 1 week.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is currently managing his diabetes with diet and exercise.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient he should refrain from hiking in the immediate postoperative period; however, he may return to walking outdoors on solid ground 1 week status post-surgery.
Medical Treatment: I recommended he follow up with his physician regarding his impending surgery. We will continue to monitor his diabetes as has been outlined by either his endocrinologist or his primary care provider.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me 1 week status post-surgery.","Doctor: Hey there! How are you feeling today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing some abdominal pain and sharp pain in my right abdomen along with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Doctor: Can you describe both types of pain for me?
Patient: The abdominal pain feels like a cramp in my stomach area, and the pain in my right abdomen is sharp and stabbing, making me feel really sick.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or experienced any fever or chills with these symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've had diarrhea and have been feeling hot and sweaty sometimes.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your urine color or frequency, or any pain or discomfort while urinating?
Patient: No, everything seems normal in that regard.
Doctor: Let's do some tests to find out what's going on. Based on your symptoms, I'll order some blood work and imaging studies.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: I noticed that your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Have you ever been diagnosed with hypertension?
Patient: Hypertension? I don't think so. What does that mean?
Doctor: It means your blood pressure is a little high. Do you have any symptoms like headaches, blurred vision, or chest pain?
Patient: No, nothing like that.
Doctor: It could indicate a risk for developing hypertension. Have you made any changes to your diet or exercise routine lately?
Patient: Not really, I've been eating the same and not exercising much.
Doctor: We should keep an eye on your blood pressure and check in again at your next appointment. Oh, and your oxygen saturation is great and you're afebrile - no fever!
Patient: Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: Speaking of your physical examination results, can you tell me what the positive Murphy sign means?
Doctor: A positive Murphy sign indicates inflammation of the gallbladder or blockage of the bile ducts. We'll conduct further tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.
Patient: I've also been experiencing constipation, decreased appetite, and nausea recently. Could these symptoms be related to the pain in my right abdomen?
Doctor: It's possible. We'll investigate these possibilities during the testing process and address any underlying issues we find. Have you tried any over-the-counter remedies for the constipation or nausea?
Patient: Yeah, I've been taking laxatives and anti-nausea medication, but they haven't helped much.
Doctor: We'll explore other options to relieve those symptoms as well. And about your disrupted sleep, have you considered any strategies to improve your sleep hygiene, like setting a regular bedtime or avoiding caffeine before bed?
Patient: I haven't tried anything specific yet, but I'll give those suggestions a shot.
Doctor: Great, let me know if you need any additional guidance in that area. Now, have you had an abdominal ultrasound recently?
Patient: Yes, I did.
Doctor: The results show that you have multiple gallstones in your gallbladder and some mild thickening. However, the size of your common bile duct is within normal limits at 4.1 mm.
Patient: Oh wow, what does that mean? Do I need surgery or something?
Doctor: We will discuss treatment options, but your symptoms could be related to your gallstones. We may need further tests and evaluations to determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding fatty and greasy foods which can exacerbate your symptoms.
Patient: Okay, thank you for the advice.
Doctor: These symptoms could also be due to stress or anxiety, which can often affect sleep and appetite. However, given your other symptoms, we should still investigate all possible causes.
Patient: Well, actually, I've been having some pain and discomfort in my pelvic area. It's been bothering me for a while now and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.
Doctor: That's concerning. We'll need to perform a pelvic exam and possibly some additional tests to determine the cause of your pelvic pain. Let's schedule another appointment to evaluate this issue further."

Patient: I've taken some over-the-counter pain relievers before, like ibuprofen. I also went to physical therapy but didn't notice much improvement.
Doctor: A low back x-ray was ordered for you. Why was the x-ray recommended?
Patient: The doctor recommended the x-ray to determine the cause of my continuous low back pain and recent fall.
Doctor: Now, let's talk about your painful urination. How long has this been going on?
Patient: When I pee, it hurts too.
Doctor: Have you had any previous issues with kidney function or urinary tract infections?
Patient: No, this is the first time I've experienced painful urination.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, we will conduct further tests to determine the cause of your lower back pain and painful urination. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity that could exacerbate your symptoms.
Patient: Okay, I will do that.
Doctor: I also want to evaluate you for nutritional deficiencies like low iron or vitamin D. We'll draw some blood so we can check for those levels.
Patient: Alright, sounds good.
Doctor: How has your blood sugar been recently?
Patient: Doctor, I've been monitoring my blood sugar every morning and it has been under control. I've also been watching what I eat and trying to exercise more.
Doctor: That's great to hear that you've been monitoring your blood sugar and making lifestyle changes. How has your overall energy level been with these changes?
Patient: I feel a bit more tired than usual, but I think that's because I've been exercising more. It's been hard to get used to.
Doctor: It can take some time for your body to adjust to new habits. Make sure you're not pushing yourself too hard and getting proper rest.
Patient: I will, thank you.
Doctor: Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of your tests and see if we need to make any adjustments. What kind of physical therapy were you referred to?
Patient: The doctor referred me to physical therapy. They will help me with exercises and treatments to improve my condition.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about the stretching, strengthening, and movement therapies recommended by your physical therapist?
Patient: Well, I don't remember all the technical names, but they showed me how to stretch my muscles and move my joints in different ways.
Doctor: Earlier you mentioned chest pain and palpitations. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yes, sometimes I feel like my heart is racing and it's painful in my chest.
Doctor: Have you noticed any specific triggers for these symptoms, such as stress, caffeine, or certain activities?
Patient: I've noticed that it usually happens when I'm feeling stressed or anxious. I don't think caffeine or activities have anything to do with it.
Doctor: Stress and anxiety can indeed trigger chest pain and palpitations. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or stress management strategies?
Patient: I've tried deep breathing exercises and mindfulness meditation, but I haven't been very consistent with them.
Doctor: Consistency is key when it comes to stress management. I encourage you to practice these techniques regularly and find what works best for you. You may also consider exploring other stress reduction methods, such as yoga, exercise, or talking to a therapist.
Patient: I'll definitely try to be more consistent with my stress management techniques. Thank you for the suggestions.
Doctor: You're welcome. It's important to take care of both your physical and mental health. Remember, we're here to help you with any concerns you may have. In the meantime, please follow the instructions for the medications and tests we discussed, and we'll see you in two weeks for a follow-up appointment.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any acute fractures or bony abnormality. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy to strengthen his right knee. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg to treat his pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.
","Doctor: Hi there, how are you feeling today?

Patient: Hello, I've been experiencing pain in my right knee for about 2.5 weeks now.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me how it started?

Patient: It started after I stepped off a curb and turned my ankle.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Now, can you tell me about the strain you experienced while playing basketball?

Patient: I was playing basketball with my friends when suddenly I felt a sharp pain in my right knee. After that, it started to swell up and hurt whenever I put pressure on it.

Doctor: I see. Let's first focus on your knee pain. I'd like to order an X-ray to determine if there's any damage to the joint.

Patient: Alright, that sounds like a good idea.

Doctor: As for the strain, we'll do a physical exam and possibly an MRI to assess the extent of the injury.

Patient: What kind of treatment options are there?

Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you noticed any improvement in your pain since starting the meloxicam?

Patient: Yeah, I think it's helping a bit. The pain isn't as bad as before.

Doctor: Great! How often have you been taking the meloxicam?

Patient: I've been taking it every day like you said.

Doctor: Have you experienced any side effects from the meloxicam?

Patient: Besides some upset stomach sometimes, I haven't had any other side effects.

Doctor: That's good to know. On a scale from 1 to 10, how severe would you say your knee pain is now?

Patient: I'd say it's around a 5 right now. It still bothers me, but not as much as before.

Doctor: Have you been able to do your daily activities without any problems?

Patient: I've been able to do my daily activities without too much difficulty.

Doctor: Alright. If the pain doesn't improve with physical therapy and medication, we may need to do an MRI to see what's going on.

Patient: And if we need to do that, when should we schedule it?

Doctor: Let's continue with the conservative treatment for now and see how it goes. We can reassess the need for an MRI in a few weeks.

Right hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alexis Gutierrez is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right hand pain.

Approximately 6 months ago, the patient began experiencing intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on her right hand. The numbness and tingling has become constant over the past month or so and is accompanied by pain with typing and using a mouse, which she does all day while working on a keyboard. She denies any sleep disturbance associated with her symptoms. Rest and ibuprofen have been the most helpful at providing symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she works on a keyboard all day.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies sleep disturbance.
Musculoskeletal: Reports pain in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.
Neurological: Reports numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right hand: Pain with flexion and extension of the wrist.. Decreased grip strength on the right compared to the left. Positive Tinel's sign.

ASSESSMENT

Right carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing her symptoms and exam findings, I believe her symptoms are secondary to carpal tunnel syndrome. We discussed the nature of this condition, as well as her treatment options, in detail. I recommend we treat this conservatively with nighttime wrist splinting and ibuprofen, but I want to increase her dose to 600 mg 4 times daily. I'm also going to order an EMG/Nerve conduction study for further evaluation. If this is positive, we can consider additional treatment with physical therapy or surgical intervention with carpal tunnel release.","Doctor: Hi there, Alexis! How are you feeling today?
Patient: Hello, Doctor. I'm doing okay.
Doctor: Can you describe the onset of your symptoms in more detail?
Patient: Yeah, sure. It started about six months ago with just occasional numbness and tingling in my first three fingers on the right hand. But now it has become constant over the past month or so, and is accompanied by pain when typing and using a mouse, which I do all day at work.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers for your numbness and tingling, such as certain activities or positions?
Patient: Not really, it seems to happen randomly.
Doctor: Have you tried any treatments or remedies to alleviate your symptoms?
Patient: I've tried shaking my hand and rubbing it, but that doesn't really help. Sometimes I try to stretch my hand out or move my fingers around. Rest and ibuprofen have been the most helpful at providing symptomatic relief.
Doctor: How often and in what dose have you been taking the ibuprofen?
Patient: I'm not sure, the bottle just says to take it every 6 hours. I usually take two pills each time.
Doctor: How has the numbness and tingling affected your daily activities and quality of life?
Patient: It's been hard to do things that require fine motor skills, like typing or writing. And it's frustrating when I can't feel things properly.
Doctor: Can you tell me if the numbness and tingling in your fingers has been progressively getting worse over time or has it stayed the same?
Patient: It's been getting worse over the past few months, and now it's happening more frequently and lasting longer.
Doctor: Have you noticed any weakness or loss of grip strength in your affected hand, and has the numbness and tingling spread to other areas?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any weakness or loss of grip strength, and the numbness and tingling has only been in my first three fingers on my right hand.
Doctor: Have you experienced any new symptoms such as pain or itching in the affected hand?
Patient: No, just the numbness and tingling.
Doctor: Have you tried any other treatments to alleviate your symptoms?
Patient: Rest and ibuprofen have been the most helpful at providing symptomatic relief.
Doctor: Can you describe the pain in your right hand?
Patient: It's like an ache and feels sharp in my first, second, and third fingers on the right hand. My fingers are swollen and they look a little red. Sometimes it feels like my fingers are numb or tingly, and it hurts more when I try to grip things or type on my computer.
Doctor: Have you been exposed to cold temperatures or repetitive motion that could be causing the pain in your right hand and fingers?
Patient: Yeah, I work on a computer all day and have been typing a lot lately. Plus it's been pretty cold outside too.
Doctor: Do you think it's possible that you have carpal tunnel syndrome?
Patient: I don't really know what that is, but maybe?
Doctor: How does your hand feel when you flex and extend your wrist?
Patient: It hurts when I move my wrist up and down. The pain is not too severe, but it's definitely noticeable. And my grip strength on the right side is weaker than my left side.
Doctor: On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the pain in your right hand when flexing and extending your wrist?
Patient: I would say it's around a 4 or 5.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, it sounds like you may have a wrist sprain. I'm going to perform a Tinel's sign test to check for nerve irritation. I will refer you to a specialist who can take a closer look and give you the best treatment options. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Hi doc, I'm not feeling well. My wrist has been hurting a lot lately.
Doctor: I see, after reviewing your symptoms and exam findings, I believe that it might be carpal tunnel syndrome. Have you heard of it before?
Patient: No, what is it?
Doctor: It's a condition where the nerve in your wrist gets compressed due to swelling, causing pain and numbness in your hand.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds terrible! What can we do about it?
Doctor: We can start by treating it conservatively with nighttime wrist splinting and ibuprofen. I'm also going to increase your dose to 600 mg 4 times daily. Additionally, I want to order an EMG/Nerve conduction study for further evaluation.
Patient: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. Will I need to make any major lifestyle changes to manage my symptoms?
Doctor: While there aren't any specific lifestyle changes necessary, it may be helpful to take frequent breaks when using your hands for extended periods of time and avoid activities that exacerbate your symptoms.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
Patient: Doctor, you asked about my appetite and weight. I haven't noticed any major changes in either of them recently.
especially when managing any medical condition. Remember to eat a balanced diet and get regular exercise, as this can help improve your overall health.
Patient: Thank you for the advice, Doctor. I'll try to be more mindful of that.
Doctor: You're welcome. If your symptoms worsen or don't improve with the conservative treatment we've discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. We can consider other treatment options, such as physical therapy or even surgery if necessary."

Patient: Honestly, I haven't been following a good diet lately. I've been eating a lot of junk food and fast food. But I know that elevated cholesterol is a concern.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about your current diet and any changes you've made to try and improve it?
Patient: Well, I've been trying to eat more fruits and vegetables, but it's hard when I'm always on the go. I also know that my high cholesterol is a concern.
Doctor: Have you considered meeting with a nutritionist or dietitian to help create a meal plan that fits your lifestyle and dietary needs?
Patient: I haven't really thought about that, but it sounds like a good idea. Do you know of any nutritionists or dietitians that you could refer me to?
Doctor: Absolutely, I can provide you with a referral. It's important to follow a balanced diet with a variety of foods that are low in saturated fat and sugars. Remaining active is also crucial.
Doctor: Additionally, we need to order a full cholesterol panel, Hemoglobin A1c, CMP, thyroid study, and liver panel. We'll also do genetic testing to see if there's a genetic cause for your elevated cholesterol.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Just remember, managing your cholesterol levels through diet and exercise is key to preventing pre-mature heart attacks.
Doctor: Have you noticed any new symptoms or changes in your health since we last saw each other?
Patient: No, I feel pretty much the same as before. However, I've been experiencing a lot of pain in my right middle finger after getting into a car accident.
Doctor: Ouch, sorry to hear that. When did this happen?
Patient: About five days ago.
Doctor: And what were you doing during the accident?
Patient: I was stopped at a four-way stop sign and got rear-ended by someone who wasn't paying attention. I hit my finger on the ceiling of the car while flipping them off.
Doctor: I see. Has this caused any other injuries?
Patient: No, just the pain in my finger.
Doctor: Alright, let's take a look at that finger and make sure there isn't any damage.
Doctor: By the way, how did your appointment with the nutritionist go?
Patient: It went well. They gave me a meal plan that works for my busy schedule and dietary needs. I feel more confident in my ability to manage my cholesterol levels now.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Remember, it takes time and effort to make significant lifestyle changes, but it's worth it for your long-term health.
Doctor: Have you received any immunizations recently?
Patient: No shots lately.
Doctor: Great! We also ordered a Hemoglobin A1c, CMP, thyroid study, and liver panel.
Doctor: Have you noticed any symptoms related to your kidneys or thyroid? Any changes in weight, energy level, urination patterns or heart rate since the abnormal lab values were identified?
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any symptoms related to my kidneys or thyroid. And I haven't noticed any changes in my weight, energy level, urination patterns or heart rate.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Were any imaging tests done during your recent medical evaluation?
Patient: Nope, no imaging was done.
Doctor: Alright, we may consider scheduling some imaging tests in the future depending on your progress with cholesterol management and any further symptoms you may experience.
Doctor: For now, let's continue focusing on your dietary and lifestyle changes to improve your overall health.
Doctor: On another note, I apologize for my previous confusion. You mentioned feeling a lot of pain and discomfort in your lower abdomen. Can you describe the pain and discomfort in more detail?
Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now and it's getting worse. The pain is constant and sometimes sharp, making it difficult for me to move comfortably.
Doctor: I see. Let's examine your lower abdomen and make sure there isn't anything serious going on. We might need to run some tests to determine the cause of your abdominal pain. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that may exacerbate the pain."

Chest pain on exertion.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a medical history of diabetes type 2. She has not been formally diagnosed with hypertension, but her blood pressures have been trending high.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports family history of heart disease.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking metformin 500 mg twice daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies diaphoresis or clamminess.
Cardiovascular: Reports chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No JVD, swelling, or carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Assessment of Respiratory Effort:
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, otherwise normal rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs. Pulses are equal.

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: No masses or tenderness. Soft, no guarding.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: 1+ nonpitting edema in the ankles. No calf tenderness.

RESULTS

EKG was obtained and reviewed in office today and is unremarkable. Hemoglobin A1c: 7.0

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Chest pain.
- Medical Reasoning: Considering her history of diabetes, possible history of hypertension, and family history of heart disease, I suspect her chest pain is likely unstable angina. Her recent EKG was unremarkable and there are no other signs of heart attack, but I am worried she may have some sort of a blockage causing her pain.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed proper protocol for sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain. I advised her to go to the emergency department if the medication is not effective after approximately 5 minutes.
- Medical Treatment: We will have her start a regimen of baby aspirin at 81 mg daily, for which I have sent in a prescription today. I also sent a prescription for nitroglycerin up to 3 tablets every 5 minutes as needed. Finally, I am going to have her follow up with cardiology for further evaluation.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: She appears to be doing well on her current regimen.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to keep her appointment with ophthalmology for evaluation of diabetic retinopathy.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to put in an order for a repeat hemoglobin A1c to check for any needed medication adjustments and have her follow up in 2 weeks. In the meantime, I want her to continue with metformin 500 mg twice daily and dietary modifications.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Several providers, including myself, have noted a trend of elevated blood pressures in the patient's chart.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor her blood pressures at home over the next 2 weeks and report her readings to me via MyChart. This should help us determine if any adjustments need to be made to her new medications. We discussed the possible side effects of hydrochlorothiazide how this will hopefully reduce some of her swelling seen on physical exam. All of her questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to have her start hydrochlorothiazide at a low dose.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.","Doctor: Good to see you again. Have you been experiencing any chest pain when you're doing physical activities like walking or climbing stairs?

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me soon.","Doctor: Hi there! So, I see in your notes that you've been experiencing bilateral knee pain. Can you tell me more about what activities or movements seem to aggravate the pain?
Patient: Yeah, it's mostly when I walk or stand for too long, and going up and down stairs can be especially bad. Even just bending my knees or squatting can hurt too.
Doctor: I see. And how severe is the pain during these activities? Does it last after you stop?
Patient: The pain can be pretty bad, like a sharp ache that makes it hard to keep going. Sometimes it feels like my knees are creaking. The pain gets worse when I transition from sitting to standing or when I go up or down stairs.
Doctor: Okay, I understand. Thank you for explaining that. We'll work together to find some solutions for managing your knee pain.
Doctor: How would you describe the pain in your knees?
Patient: It's like a deep, achy pain in the back of my knees. Sometimes they feel like they're ""creaking."" The pain gets worse when I transition from sitting to standing or when I go up or down stairs.
Doctor: Alright, based on your symptoms, I'll write down ""bilateral knee pain and crepitus"" in your chart. We'll need to take a closer look at what might be causing your pain.
Doctor: Have you tried taking any over-the-counter pain relievers for your knee pain?
Patient: Yes, I took some ibuprofen, but it didn't really help much.
Doctor: Okay. Now, do you happen to know if anyone in your family has a history of kidney disease or thyroid disorders? We noticed some abnormal levels in your recent labs.

Doctor: Okay, thanks for letting me know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, weight, or energy levels lately? These could be related to the abnormal thyroid levels we saw.
Patient: Not really, I feel pretty normal overall. My appetite and energy levels seem to be about the same as usual.
Doctor: Understood. Finally, do you know if heart disease runs in your family at all? We noticed some sinus tachycardia on your EKG.
Patient: Hmm, I'm not really sure. I know my grandma had high blood pressure, but I don't know if that means there's a history of heart disease too.
Doctor: Okay, no problem. And have you noticed any symptoms such as muscle weakness, tremors, or difficulty sleeping related to your abnormal thyroid levels?
Patient: Nope, none of those things. I've been sleeping well and my muscles feel normal.
Doctor: Can you describe the location and severity of the pain in your knees when you experience tenderness on palpation or a positive patellar grind test?
Patient: The pain is in my knees and it hurts when you press on them or when you do that patellar grind thing. It's been hard to squat because of the pain.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any deformity in your legs or any issues with your walking or gait?
Patient: No, everything seems normal in terms of my walking and there are no deformities that I know of.

Patient: No, I haven't had any injury to my back recently.
Doctor: Have you had any previous episodes of back pain in the past?
Patient: I have had some occasional back pain in the past, but this feels different.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have a herniated disc in your lower back. Have you experienced any difficulty with bowel or bladder function?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any problems with that.
Doctor: A herniated disc means that one of the discs between the vertebrae in your spine has ruptured or slipped out of place. Have you noticed any improvement or worsening of your back pain since it first started?
Patient: It's been about the same since it started, maybe a little worse.
Doctor: Have you tried any heat or ice therapy to alleviate the pain?
Patient: I haven't tried heat or ice yet, should I?
Doctor: Yes, you can try using heat or ice therapy to see if it helps alleviate the pain.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, I would also recommend trying non-medical treatments like stretching or massage. If the pain persists or worsens, we can explore other options.
Doctor: I noticed from your medical history that you mentioned you have a sedentary job where you sit at a desk most of the time. It's important to take breaks and stretch throughout the day to avoid exacerbating the pain.
Doctor: Hi there, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Hi doctor, my lower back has been hurting a lot lately.

Patient: The pain seems to get worse when I'm sitting or standing for too long.
Doctor: On a scale from 1-10, how would you rate your pain?
Patient: I would say my pain is about an 8.
Doctor: Have you tried any remedies or treatments to alleviate the discomfort?
Patient: I haven't tried anything yet, but sometimes I use a heating pad to help ease the pain.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement or worsening of your lower back pain since we last spoke?
Patient: The pain is still about the same.
Doctor: Have you tried any new methods for managing the discomfort?
Patient: I haven't tried anything new, but I've been trying to stretch and move around more to see if it helps.
Patient: By the way, the MRI showed lumbar back pain at L4-5 disc space due to herniated disc with radiculopathy. What does that mean?
Doctor: Based on the MRI results, it appears that you have a herniated disc in your lower back that is causing the pain and possibly affecting the nerves in your leg.
Doctor: We will need to explore further treatment options, such as physical therapy or medication, to manage the pain and prevent any further damage.
Doctor: In the meantime, continue with the heat and ice therapy and stretching exercises to help alleviate the discomfort.
Doctor: Hey there! So, we're going to start with a conservative treatment plan and give you a corticosteroid injection in your lower back. Is that okay with you?
Patient: Sure, but what are the possible risks involved with getting an injection like this?
Doctor: Well, we always have to be careful about the risk of bleeding or infection, as well as nerve or blood vessel damage.
Doctor: I also want to make sure you're aware that if you're diabetic, there is a risk of elevated glucose levels.
Patient: Okay, thanks for letting me know.
Doctor: Have you had any previous reactions to corticosteroids, or any issues with bleeding or infections in the past?
Patient: No, I haven't had any bad reactions before, and I don't have any infections right now.
Doctor: That's good to hear. We'll make sure to monitor everything carefully during and after the injection.
Doctor: Do you have any questions before we get started?
Patient: No, I think I'm good. Let's do it."
