Doctor: Hi Christine, how have you been feeling lately? I see from your medical history that you have a history of high blood pressure and depression. How have those been recently?
Patient: My depression has been under control, I'm taking my medication as prescribed and going to therapy every week. My blood pressure has been fluctuating but I'm using my medications as recommended.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your blood pressure more closely and discuss any further concerns you have. Also, it's important to have an annual exam. Would you like to schedule one now?
Patient: Sure, let's do that. Have you been experiencing any headaches lately?
Doctor: Yes, I've been having some headaches. Are they happening frequently or only occasionally?
Patient: They're pretty frequent.
Doctor: Have you noticed anything that triggers them or makes them worse?
Patient: No, not really. They just come on randomly.
Doctor: Okay, we can work on improving that. We'll get some tests done to check your blood pressure and see if there's anything else going on. During our last visit, we noted that your mood and affect were appropriate. Have you noticed any changes in your emotional state since then?
Patient: No, everything has been fine on that front.
Doctor: Great to hear. Let's move on to your physical exam. Your neck appears supple without any signs of thyromegaly or cervical lymphadenopathy. Did you notice any discomfort or swelling in this area?
Patient: No, I haven't experienced any issues with my neck recently. So, what does elevated mean? Do I have high blood pressure?
Doctor: Elevated means higher than the normal range. Based on your previous visit, it seems that your blood pressure was higher than normal. Have you experienced any headaches or vision changes lately?
Patient: Oh, I see. Yes, I think you mentioned that last time. No, I haven't had any headaches or problems with my vision.
Doctor: Okay, let's monitor your blood pressure more closely and make sure it stays within a healthy range. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or ask about?
Patient: Not really, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, doctor. By the way, I've been struggling with hypertension due to my busy schedule at work and unhealthy eating habits. Any suggestions?
Doctor: Have you tried meal prepping on the weekends or utilizing healthy food delivery services to make eating healthier more convenient for your busy schedule?
Patient: No, I haven't tried that yet. That could be a good idea though!
Doctor: Okay, we'll increase your lisinopril to 10 mg once daily and continue to monitor at home. Let's follow up in 1 month. Switching gears, how is your carpal tunnel release doing? It's been 2 years since the surgery, right?
Patient: Yeah, everything has been fine. I haven't had any symptoms.
Doctor: Great to hear. Just remember to contact us if any symptoms return. Lastly, just to confirm, you understand and agree with the recommended medical treatment plan?
Patient: Yes, I do.
Doctor: Alright then. Take care and we'll see you next month.
