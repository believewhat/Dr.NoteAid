Doctor: Hey there, Ms. Hill! So, I see you've been having joint pain in your knees and wrists for a few weeks now. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yeah, it's been pretty painful and it makes it difficult to walk or use my hands.
Doctor: That sounds tough. Have you tried any pain relievers to help with the pain?
Patient: Yes, but they only provide temporary relief.
Doctor: How about using heat pads or ice packs?
Patient: I've tried those too, but the relief is still temporary.
Doctor: Okay, let's order some tests to figure out what might be causing the pain. Now, about your left elbow due to repetitive trauma, can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Sure, it's caused olecranon bursitis and it's been really painful and swollen.
Doctor: Have you tried any remedies for your elbow pain and swelling?
Patient: I've been taking meloxicam once a day as directed and resting my arm while icing the area.
Doctor: And are you resting your arm on a pillow to alleviate pressure?
Patient: Yes, I've been doing that as well.
Doctor: Let's focus on your joint pain for now, and we'll follow up on your elbow later. Have you noticed any nasal congestion lately?
Patient: Yeah, I have allergies that cause congestion.
Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications for your allergies?
Patient: No, I haven't been taking anything for them.
Doctor: How has your depression been? Any improvement or worsening of your symptoms?
Patient: It's been pretty bad, it's hard to get going in the morning.
Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications for your depression?
Patient: Yes, I'm taking 50mg of sertraline once a day at night.
Doctor: How has therapy been for your depression?
Patient: It's been helpful, but I still feel down and stressed.
Doctor: I see that you have epilepsy and peptic ulcer disease. Are you still taking Keppra and Protonix for those conditions?
Patient: Yes, I am.
Doctor: Can you confirm the dosage and frequency of carbamazepine you're taking for your epilepsy?
Patient: I'm taking 200mg of carbamazepine once a day at night.
Doctor: Have you experienced any side effects from your medications?
Patient: Sometimes I feel dizzy or sleepy after taking them, but it usually goes away.
Doctor: How about your seizure frequency and mood since starting the medications?
Patient: My seizures happen less often and my mood has improved since starting the sertraline.
Doctor: Excellent. For now, continue taking ibuprofen as needed for the joint pain and rest your joints when possible. We'll follow up soon with test results. Sound good?
Patient: Sounds good, Doctor. Thank you.
Doctor: Lastly, are you experiencing any chest pain, nausea, or shortness of breath?
Patient: A little bit of nausea sometimes, but nothing else.
Doctor: Alright, thank you for letting me know. If anything changes, don't hesitate to reach out.
