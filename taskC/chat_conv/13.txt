Doctor: Hey there, it's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since your shunt surgery for hydrocephalus? And how has Mr. Watson been doing since his shunt surgery in August 2020?
Patient: I've been feeling okay since the surgery, thanks for asking. My dad has been doing pretty well too. He's been feeling better and his headaches have gone down a bit.
Doctor: That's great progress for both of you. Have either of you noticed any changes in your symptoms or overall health since the shunt surgeries?
Patient: Well, I don't feel as much pressure in my head anymore and my headaches have decreased. But sometimes I still feel a little off. My dad hasn't had any major issues since his surgery, we're just glad that it seems to have helped him.
Doctor: Okay, that's good to hear. How is your recovery progressing following the shunt surgery? Have you experienced any issues with wound healing, pain management, or mobility?
Patient: My recovery is going pretty well. I'm able to move around just fine without any pain or complications. And my dad hasn't had any side effects since his surgery either.
Doctor: Great! Can you tell me more about the trouble you're having walking and cognitive impairment?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble walking and my mind feels a bit foggy. It's been going on for a while now. Sometimes I forget things easily and have trouble concentrating on tasks for too long.
Doctor: When did you first notice these symptoms, and have they progressed over time?
Patient: I can't remember exactly when it started, but it's getting worse over time. It's harder to walk without stumbling and my thinking is slowing down too. I've also been experiencing gait impairment and urinary incontinence and urgency.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms related to adult hydrocephalus, it seems that there may be some cognitive impairment as well. We will need to run some tests to get a better idea of what is going on. Also, I see that you had a CT scan of the head. Can you tell me more about the tiny amount of blood in your right frontal region and small vessel ischemic change?
Patient: Oh yeah, they found a little bit of blood in my right frontal region and some small vessel ischemic change during the scan. I was feeling dizzy and had a headache for a few days before the scan.
Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your vision or speech since the scan?
Patient: No, my vision and speech are okay. Sometimes I feel a little off balance, but nothing too bad.
Doctor: Any other symptoms besides dizziness, headache, and off-balance sensation?
Patient: No, my memory and concentration are okay. It's just the dizziness and headache that bother me sometimes. I've also been feeling more anxious and stressed lately because of my cognitive difficulties.
Doctor: Overall, it sounds like we need to investigate further regarding your cognitive and walking issues, as well as the small vessel ischemic change seen on your CT scan. We will schedule some tests and appointments to get a better understanding of what's happening. In the meantime, I can prescribe some medication to help manage your symptoms. 
Patient: Thanks, doc. I really appreciate it.
Doctor: Absolutely. By the way, I've noticed in your medical history that you've had some issues with urinary incontinence and gait impairment. Are you still experiencing those symptoms?
Patient: Yes, unfortunately. They haven't gotten any better.
Doctor: Okay, we'll definitely look into that further during our upcoming evaluations. Also, I recommend scheduling another follow-up appointment in 3 months to check on your progress. Does that work for you?
Patient: Sure, that works for me.
Doctor: Alright, thank you for coming in today. Take care and stay healthy!
Patient: You too, doc. Thanks again.
