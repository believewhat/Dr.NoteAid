Doctor: Have you noticed any specific activities or movements that seem to worsen the pain?
Patient: Yeah, whenever I try to lift something heavy or grip something tightly, it really hurts.

Doctor: Has that been helping at all?
Patient: It helps a little, but the pain is still there.
Doctor: Okay, let's schedule you for some physical therapy to help alleviate the pain. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that make the pain worse.
Patient: Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: Any other symptons?
Patient's Answer:No, I don't have any other symptoms. I'm doing alright, thanks for asking.
Doctor: Let's start by checking in on your left elbow pain. Have you been using a pillow to rest your arm on and applying ice regularly to alleviate the pain?
Patient: Yes, I've been doing both of those things and it's getting better.
Doctor: That's good to hear. How about your epilepsy? Have you been taking your Keppra and have you had any recent seizures?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking my medication as prescribed and haven't had any recent seizures.
Doctor: Great to hear that. How has your counseling and therapy been going for your depression?

Patient: No, I haven't had any problems recently.
Doctor: Okay, good. How has the medical treatment been going for your peptic ulcer disease? 
Patient: Sorry, I think there's been a miscommunication. I haven't been taking Protonix for my peptic ulcer disease.
Doctor: Oh, my mistake. Can you tell me more about how the treatment has been going then?
Patient: It's been okay, but I haven't had an endoscopy yet to check on it.
Doctor: Got it. We'll make sure to schedule one soon. Lastly, how effective has the medical treatment been for your epilepsy and peptic ulcer disease overall?
Patient: They've been helping, but there's still room for improvement.
