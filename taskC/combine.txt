For example:

First One:

Doctor: hey , ms. hill . nice to see you .
Patient: hi , dr. james , good to see you .
Doctor: hey , dragon , i'm seeing ms. hill . she's a 41-year-old female , and what brings you in today ?
Patient: um , i am having a lot of pain at the end of my right middle finger .
Doctor: what did you do ?
Patient: a little embarrassing . um , i got rear-ended , slow motor , uh , vehicle accident , and i got really angry with the person who hit me , so i went to flip him the bird , but i was a little too enthusiastic .
Patient: and i hit the ceiling of the car .
Doctor: okay . when did this happen ?
Patient: uh , it was saturday , so about four , five days ago .
Doctor: five days ago . what were you doing ? were you , like , stopped at a stoplight ? a stop sign ?
Patient: yes . so i was stopped at a four-way stop , and it was not my turn to go . there were other cars going , and the person behind me just was n't watching . i think they were texting and rear-ended me .



Second One:

Doctor: how much damage to your car ?
Patient: uh , not too much . the , the trunk crumpled up a little bit .
Doctor: okay . and no other injuries ? just the finger ?
Patient: just the middle finger .
Doctor: so you would've escaped this accident without any injuries ?
Patient: yes . uh , i'm not proud .
Doctor: okay . um , so four days of right middle finger pain-
Patient: yes .
Doctor: . after a motor vehicle accident .
Patient: yes .


Your Answer should only be one long conversation:

Doctor: hey , ms. hill . nice to see you .
Patient: hi , dr. james , good to see you .
Doctor: hey , dragon , i'm seeing ms. hill . she's a 41-year-old female , and what brings you in today ?
Patient: um , i am having a lot of pain at the end of my right middle finger .
Doctor: what did you do ?
Patient: a little embarrassing . um , i got rear-ended , slow motor , uh , vehicle accident , and i got really angry with the person who hit me , so i went to flip him the bird , but i was a little too enthusiastic .
Patient: and i hit the ceiling of the car .
Doctor: okay . when did this happen ?
Patient: uh , it was saturday , so about four , five days ago .
Doctor: five days ago . what were you doing ? were you , like , stopped at a stoplight ? a stop sign ?
Patient: yes . so i was stopped at a four-way stop , and it was not my turn to go . there were other cars going , and the person behind me just was n't watching . i think they were texting and rear-ended me .
Doctor: how much damage to your car ?
Patient: uh , not too much . the , the trunk crumpled up a little bit .

Patient: yes . uh , i'm not proud .
